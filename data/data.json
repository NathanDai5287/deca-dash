      "explanation": "Corporation. Stockholders in corporations have limited liability; that is, their losses are limited to the amount of money that they have invested in the business. Partnerships and sole proprietorships have unlimited liability, meaning that the business owners are personally liable for debts incurred by the business. Joint proprietorship is not a form of business ownership."

Due process is the concept that a jurisdiction's government must respect all of the legal rights that are owed to individuals and businesses according to the law of the land. Legal procedure refers to the methods that are used to protect an individual's or business's legal rights. Generally, these rights in a democratic society include the right to obtain legal counsel, the right to be heard in court, the right to confront the accuser, etc. The importance of following legal procedure is not to provide each party with unique rights, specific duties, or formal requests."

If Alex Smith is a woman, she might be offended if Rosa uses \u201cDear Mr. Smith.\u201d \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d shouldn't ever be used. It's important to find out to whom to address the letter, even if it's just to a title, such as \u201cVice President.\u201d In Rosa's case, she knows the name of the recipient, so she should use that. \u201cDear Alex\u201d is too informal for a business letter.

Even though the person is behaving in an unacceptable manner, they may have a legitimate complaint that needs attention. Taking time to identify the problem is the first step in solving it. The employee should not interrupt the customer unless absolutely necessary. The employee also should not tell the customer to be quiet or to come back when they are calmer."

Insurance is a contractual agreement in which one company (insurer) will pay for specified losses incurred by the other company (insured) in return for installment payments (premium). Many individuals purchase life insurance policies to ensure that their loved ones receive financial support in the event of death. Life insurance is a wise purchase for an individual whose loved ones (e.g., spouse, children, parents, etc.) would suffer financially without the deceased's income. Disability insurance provides financial support in the event that you cannot work due to an injury or illness. Health insurance helps cover the cost of medical expenses. Renter's insurance protects you from loss in the event that your personal property is damaged or lost while living in a rented apartment or house."

      "explanation": "Negative work culture. Tacit knowledge is expertise that is often difficult to explain or quantify. Businesses with positive work cultures tend to encourage openness and sharing, which builds trust among employees. When coworkers trust one another and feel valued by their employers, they are more likely to share their tacit knowledge with one another. Negative work environments tend to foster a distrustful environment, which often discourages employees from sharing their expertise. In these situations, employees are often fearful about losing their jobs and are more likely to keep helpful information to themselves. An unsatisfactory credit rating, uncooperative vendors, and poor customer service levels are not primary reasons why employees withhold tacit knowledge from coworkers."

      "explanation": "Email. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight, and information of internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. The key to effective knowledge management is getting employees to share their \"personal know-how\" with managers and coworkers. Technology is often used to capture and share this knowledge. The best way for Kendra to share her discovery is by email. She can construct her message and send it to many people at one time. Kendra would probably not post this information on the company's website, because this information is not meaningful to customers or website visitors.

      "explanation": "Reverse engineering. Reverse engineering is the process of examining the makeup of an existing product on the market. By reviewing the components of the product through independent discovery, a competitor can apply the findings to recreate the product. Although this is a legal practice under trade secret laws in Canada and the United States, it does hinder the ability to maintain trade secrets for certain types of processes, ingredients, etc. Process fragmentation involves limiting the amount of information employees have about an entire process, which lessens the risk that the company's trade secret will be revealed. Copyrights legally protect written and artistic works rather than trade secrets. Therefore, any reforms to copyright laws would not affect trade secrets. Systematic neutralizing is a fictitious term."

One technique involves observing an employee while they are performing their job and taking notes about each step in the process. The purpose of task analysis is to obtain a deeper understanding of the job task. Participation involves actually carrying out the steps in a process or job task to gain knowledge. Learning histories are similar to lessons learned summaries or debriefings. This involves reviewing important events that have occurred and documenting the successes and mistakes experienced during the event. The learning histories can help other managers gain insights when they encounter similar situations in the future.

Analyzing past sales records (e.g., invoices) helps a business forecast future sales, which aids in planning other activities such as promotion. Businesses do not keep customer records so that they can negotiate with competitors. To obtain a favorable credit rating, a business must pay its bills when they are due.

Therefore, it is important to store the information for future use so it will be accessible when needed. For example, information about current customers might be used to develop procedures for attracting new customers in the future. If the information has not been stored so it is accessible, the business will need to obtain other types of information. Businesses do not need to store information to establish quality control.

A significant number of workplace injuries are the result of slipping, tripping, and falling on unsafe walking and work surfaces (e.g., floors, stairs, sidewalks, loading docks, etc.). One way that businesses can reduce these accidents is by salting or sanding icy patches on their sidewalks, parking lots, loading docks, and outdoor wheelchair ramps during winter weather.

      "explanation": "Asking the supplier to sign nondisclosure agreements. The free flow of information between supplier and buyer is an important part of building lasting supplier relationships. Open information sharing can cut costs and assure that these relationships benefit both parties. Providing false information, trying to use information as leverage, or not trusting a supplier are not effective ways to build trust or create open lines of communication and lasting relationships."

      "explanation": "Special. A special order is a request for a custom product or a product that a vendor does not normally carry in stock. Because the Frederick Company needs a shelving unit that has unusual measurements, the vendor needs to custom-make it for the company. An open order is an order for staple goods that is placed with one of several available vendors who can meet the business's immediate requirements (e.g., time, price, quantity). A blanket order is an order that covers all or part of a retailer's seasonal requirements. A reorder is an order for items that the business has previously purchased. There is not enough information provided to determine if the Frederick Company has previously ordered the same custom-made shelves."

Often oriented around customer satisfaction, the steps in a business process are clearly defined and laid out in a business process map that is shared throughout the organization and its stakeholders. An organizational chart may accompany or be influenced by the process design, but it is not the direct result. Similarly, a shareholder presentation may be created to communicate the business process design or map with shareholders in an attempt to demonstrate process efficiency, but this is not the direct result of the development of a business process.

Dividing the entire project into smaller components helps the project manager identify tasks and effectively schedule, assign, and monitor complex project activities. By dividing the work into smaller packages, the project manager defines each task and the team member(s) who will perform the tasks, which prevents the duplication of work.

In this example, the network diagram shows the major steps of the project from beginning to end. For example, each task in Kevin's project requires substeps that would be diagrammed in a work breakdown structure (e.g., substeps required to prepare house for painting: take down shutters, scrape off chipping paint, etc.). A scope management plan defines the project's purpose and rationale, the results to be achieved, and the products to be developed. A project charter is a written overview of a project that includes information such as the project purpose, goals, and products. It also identifies the project manager and authorizes them to begin work on the project."

If focused on individual employees, the automated oversight technology tracks each employee's activity to determine if and when they exceed the preset risk limit. If the employee exceeds their limit, the software notifies management immediately. Management can then take the necessary actions to reduce the risk exposure. Financial analysts use stress testing to determine a particular financial instrument's stability in different extreme events.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Conduct background checks on job applicants. Because hiring and training employees is an expense for businesses, they should ensure that the applicants' previous work experiences do not present business risks for them. Because applicants are unlikely to discuss unfavorable past work experiences during an interview, businesses need to take action to verify the information on their employment applications. Employers should confirm the applicants' previous employment, verify their references, and conduct background checks on applicants if needed. CopyIt may have reduced its liability by checking the drivers' previous driving records and employment history before extending job offers to them. There is not enough information provided to determine if the accidents involve substance abuse, so mandating monthly drug testing for all employees may not prevent future driving accidents. Requiring current drivers to take a driving exam every six months will not prevent the business from hiring unsafe drivers."

Many businesses encourage employees to participate in group discussions to analyze problems and find solutions. The advantage is that when employees share many different opinions, there is an increase in the chance of developing useful recommendations.

      "explanation": "Elizabeth structures a national insurance company's financial reports by branch. Geographical order puts information in order based on the geographic location, such as business region or branch. When a business wants to evaluate or compare the financial performance of each business location, the geographic organizational approach is appropriate to use. Ben is organizing information for school rather than business and is using a chronological format for his timeline. The chronological format involves placing information in sequence according to time. Corinne is organizing information by value because she is listing homes by selling price. Jacob is using the deductive approach to organize his research report. The deductive approach involves presenting the main ideas, recommendations, and most important information in the first part of the report."

      "explanation": "To overcome communication barriers. Visual or graphic aids help in overcoming a number of communication barriers that may arise during a sales presentation, including information overload, processing and retention, language barriers, and time constraints. Salespeople should always explain the information presented in the graphic aids, so graphic aids do not necessarily limit how much a salesperson talks during a presentation. Graphic and visual aids are just as falsifiable as any other information. Even with graphic aids, a salesperson should ensure that their appearance is professional and appropriate for the presentation they are giving."

      "explanation": "Body language. Body language is gestures, facial expression, or any other form of communicating without words. An employee's body language conveys a message to customers. For example, if an employee is talking to one customer and ignores a new customer, the employee's body language is telling the new customer that they are not important. On the other hand, an employee who smiles or motions that they will be with the customer shortly is communicating an interest in providing good service. Employees usually do not communicate their social status to customers. The verbal and nonverbal communications employees use during the closing statements indicate their interest in being of service, not the closing statements themselves. Informal product demonstrations do not communicate interest in providing good service to customers."

The longer the period of time money is borrowed, the higher the amount of interest charged on the loan will be. List prices are prices established by a seller of goods, services, or resources, and they are not affected by customer complaints.

When the demand price (the maximum price buyers are willing to pay for a product) of a product increases, certain customers may be unable to afford the product anymore. As a result, they may substitute the product with a cheaper one. This is the substitution effect\u2014not equilibrium price, excess demand, or excess supply. The equilibrium price, or market-clearing price, occurs when the quantity of a product that buyers want to buy is equal to the quantity that sellers are willing to sell at a certain price.

Recommending a competitor's product should generate goodwill by helping the customer find the appropriate product.

A passive person usually displays an attitude based on the desire to avoid conflict at all costs. When Ryan puts his own needs aside to help a coworker, he is behaving passively. Aggressive behavior is conduct based on a willingness to ignore the rights of others and to take advantage of them to achieve personal goals. Forceful behavior would likely be considered aggressive.

It's nice to try to cooperate when resolving a conflict, but this doesn't have anything to do with input from a neutral third party.

Sometimes companies do not need to change product characteristics but need to change the way in which products are promoted to conform to cultural values and preferences in other countries. This is referred to as promotional adaptation. Customization refers to changing aspects of the product itself, while globalization means keeping the product and its promotional messages the same throughout the world. Global myopia is a fictitious term."

An inability to get along with coworkers can result in a dysfunctional work environment, which often prompts an employer to dismiss the employee. Employees who perform their jobs adequately and generate ideas are not as likely to be terminated as those who cannot get along with coworkers.

Because credit card holders often pay high interest rates and other fees, they must be careful when using their credit cards so they don't charge more than they can pay off in a reasonable time frame. Using credit cards to make large-dollar purchases often makes it easier to change or cancel transactions such as airfare. In fact, many businesses prefer credit cards as a payment method.

The check register is a central location to record and track all of the checks that you write and the amount of money you spend in your checking account. Each month, you receive a bank statement that details your checking account activity. You should reconcile your check register with your bank statement to ensure that they match. This step is important for many reasons. For example, if you forget to enter transactions in your checkbook register, you may overdraft your account and be fined for insufficient funds.

Stock mutual funds are combinations of stocks from different corporations or agencies, usually from different industries. The idea behind mutual funds is that they aren't as risky as buying individual stocks, but they offer a good chance of receiving a return. The return Marco gets will depend on how much risk he's willing to take. A savings account is a lending investment in which you lend money to a bank for the benefit of being able to access your money at any time. Savings accounts are very low risk, but they don't make much money. With money market accounts, you're able to access some of your money each month, but not all of it. There's a slightly higher interest rate than with a savings account. A bond is a lending opportunity offered by a government, municipality, or corporation. Bonds are low risk, but you have to be willing to leave your money with the borrower for a long time (sometimes as long as 30 years!)."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Assign the new employee a mentor who can answer any questions they may have. One simple way to make an employee feel comfortable is to assign a mentor. The mentor doesn't need to be the employee's direct supervisor\u2014  they just need to be someone who can show the new employee the ropes. It will help the new employee to have one ready-made friend who can show them around. Lucia should provide some sort of orientation for the new employee before they start working. There are many important things the employee will need to know about the company's policies and their benefits. Although it is important to make sure the employee has information about the projects they are working on, Lucia won't want to overwhelm the new employee with too much information on the first day. It's also important not to give the employee busy work that doesn't fit into their job description. After all, that's not why the employee was hired, and this won't help the new employee become more comfortable at work."

      "explanation": "To control expenses. By selecting the most appropriate methods of distribution, marketers are able to control expenses, thereby improving a business's chances of making a profit. An effective distribution system also keeps marketers from tying up capital unnecessarily in inventory. Distribution systems enable marketers to have adequate supplies of goods in the right place at the right time. Purchasing supplies is an operations activity that relates to the business function. Selling benefits is part of the selling function of marketing. Regulating prices is part of the pricing function of marketing."

There are many accounting software programs available for businesses to use. Expert systems are software programs that mimic the knowledge of human experts, such as auto mechanics or doctors. Networking abilities refer to connecting employees and information on a group of computers, either with cables or wirelessly. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Cut and paste. Businesspeople use word processing software programs to create text documents such as business letters, memos, reports, etc. Word processing software programs have many features and functions that allow the computer user to manipulate text. For example, the cut function allows the user to select a block of text and remove it from a certain location. By moving the curser to another location and selecting the paste function, the user can place the previously cut text into a different part of the document. This process eliminates the need to delete text and retype it in a different section of the document, which can be time-consuming. The copy function copies the selected text but does not remove it from its existing location. If the text is not copied before it is deleted, then it would not be possible to move the text to a new location in the document."

Many businesses use database software to maintain customer lists that can be arranged alphabetically, by zip code, by date of last purchase, or by many other criteria. This type of software allows businesses to generate mailing lists of specific customers based on a variety of factors. Businesses use spreadsheet software to track operating expenses, desktop publishing programs to prepare annual reports, and graphics programs to design company stationery."

      "explanation": "Willing to do whatever is needed. To be an effective team member, workers should be willing to do whatever is needed to meet the team's goals. This may include carrying out tasks or accepting assignments that are not to the individual's liking. It may also mean that the individual cannot be so committed to personal career goals that they cannot set them aside, at least temporarily. Workers do not need to have had previous experience as team members since the role of team player can be learned. Conflict is often part of teamwork and should be managed rather than avoided."

One mode of collaboration involves links or networks that connect several people via computer. For example, when two business employees in different locations have the ability to turn on their computers and access the same inventory status information to see if a product is in stock for a customer, they are using a groupware application.

      "explanation": "Use short blocks of text. Since most people want information quickly, they tend to scan over the web page rather than read the text in detail. Therefore, short blocks of text are often most effective in grabbing the reader's attention. In some situations, such as presenting a product's features, the text may be presented in a bullet-point format. Using too many fonts may make the text difficult to read. Applicable graphics should be included on the web page to add interest. Not all web pages include advertising, so leaving space for banner ads is not always necessary."

The type of information they need depends on the business and the specific problem.

When evaluating the quality of online information, it is important to consider factors such as the source type, the author's expertise, and the publication date. The Harvard professor has extensive knowledge about the topic of economics. The article was published last month, so it likely reflects current events and is up to date.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Makes it easier to comparison shop. The continuing growth of the internet (e-commerce) allows consumers to log onto their computers and visit several websites to compare products and prices. This makes comparison shopping easier because consumers do not need to call or drive to multiple businesses to obtain the desired product information. The internet benefits businesses because it allows them to promote their products on their websites. Another way that the internet affects businesses is that it often reduces the need to use intermediaries to get the products to the end users. Because there is so much information available through the internet, people may suffer from information overload, which is a disadvantage of the internet."

      "explanation": "Comply with government regulations. Governments regulate the ways in which companies record, maintain, and store various types of business information. For example, in the United States, corporations must comply with the laws detailed in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These laws were put in place to increase transparency and reduce questionable recordkeeping practices related to business financial information. If companies do not comply with these rules, they may be subject to fines and other legal repercussions. Working remotely, prioritizing the information, and lessening the effects of information overload are not primary reasons why businesses are required to manage financial information in specific ways."

Andre is likely overcommitted because he struggles to say no to people who ask him to take on new responsibilities and tasks. Therefore, his schedule is likely packed, and he probably struggles to manage all that he has committed to do. There is no indication that Andre is a perfectionist, disorganized, or a leader."

      "explanation": "Conduct safety inspections. By periodically inspecting the work environment, managers can determine if employees are following the business's safety procedures. To determine if employees are following the safety procedures, managers may monitor employees who are operating production equipment, or they may check the facility to make sure that aisles and exits are not blocked by boxes. Monitoring computer usage will not ensure that employees are following the business's safety procedures. Simply installing security equipment, such as surveillance cameras, will not ensure that employees are following safety rules\u2014the business must review the surveillance video to determine if employees are violating safety procedures. Including safety policies in the employee handbook is a way to inform the employees about the business's safety policies and procedures; however, this action does not ensure that employees follow the procedures."

The customer should not be moved until qualified medical personnel have examined the customer to determine the proper course of action.

Planning to update a product is part of a business's production process. Updating a product is less expensive than designing a new product. A popcorn company may decide to update its popcorn products by adding vitamins or flavorings rather than spending a lot of money designing completely new products.

In the workplace, it is important to coordinate tasks, especially when one employee must complete a task so another employee can perform the next task in the process that is needed to complete a required activity. In the example, each employee requires a coworker to complete a task so the next person can do their job; therefore, the work must be coordinated so it is performed in a certain sequence.

      "explanation": "A small company does not have the funds to go to court. Settlement occurs when the defendant in a case agrees to some or all of the plaintiff's claims and decides not to go to court, usually instead paying a monetary amount. Settlement is often a more affordable option than a costly legal battle that the defendant may not even win. Therefore, if a small company is the defendant in a case, it might agree to settle to save money. Settlements can keep companies out of the spotlight, rather than bringing them publicity. If a defendant feels they have a strong chance of winning, they might want to pursue the case in court rather than settling because they could receive a much larger payment. Finally, complicated cases with many defendants are more difficult to settle because some might want to settle while others do not."

While the mediator cannot make a decision that resolves the disagreement, they can work with both sides to find points of agreement to help provide solution suggestions. This process asks the parties to come together, unlike in litigation, which is often combative and hostile when parties are pitted against each other. Mediation is more flexible than litigation because it does not impose a resolution on both parties. Both mediation and litigation can be personal. The necessity of either mediation or litigation depends on the disagreement."

If a caller wants to speak to a specific employee who is unavailable, it is most courteous to ask if you can take a message or ask the caller if they would like to leave a voicemail. There isn't enough information to determine if the caller wants to place an order or if you are in the position to help the caller. If Rhonda is in a meeting or out of the building, putting the caller on hold until you track her down or asking them to call back in a few minutes are not viable options.

Ways you can use posture to express assertiveness include standing up straight when speaking, leaning toward the speaker to show your interest in what is being said, or crossing your arms across your chest to indicate a negative response to what is being said. Explaining why you must refuse a request for help is an example of verbal assertiveness. Raising your eyebrows and frowning are facial expressions used in nonverbal assertiveness."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Gender. A stereotype is a set image or assumption about a person or thing. When people stereotype others, they tend to classify certain people as a group that possesses certain characteristics. These characteristics are often based on distorted beliefs or unreliable information. A person who stereotypes others often fails to see an individual who possesses unique skills, values, and attitudes. Gender is one characteristic by which people often stereotype others. Assuming men are more assertive than women in business situations is a distorted belief. In fact, many women are very assertive in business situations. Ethnic stereotyping involves having false beliefs about a person on the basis of their race or culture. Stereotypes about religion involve having distorted beliefs about a person's spiritual practices. An individual who stereotypes by age might feel that younger people do not possess needed knowledge or that older people are feeble and lack adaptability."

      "explanation": "Attitudes can be helped with humor. Being able to laugh at yourself and at annoying things that happen is very good for your positive attitude. It keeps you from taking yourself too seriously and helps you keep things in perspective. Changing attitudes won't happen overnight. Our attitudes develop from the time we are children, and they can't be changed that easily. Energy is like the common cold\u2014contagious. Surrounding yourself with positive people will have a positive effect on your attitude. Your attitude is one of the few things in life over which you have complete control.

      "explanation": "Add to the cost of the purchase. Using credit can add to the total cost of goods and services. For example, interest or finance charges are added to accounts that are not paid in full at the end of each payment period. When customers buy products with a credit card, they often pay over a period of time. Then, each month they pay interest on the unpaid balance. The interest charges add to the cost of the purchase. Interest charges do not increase the retail price, because customers who pay in cash are not charged interest. Interest usually is calculated monthly rather than yearly. Interest generates profit for the credit card company rather than the store."

Many times, employees find ways that help them manage their workload\u2014things that aren't always written in their job descriptions. This personal knowledge is acquired by trial and error, which occurs by repeating tasks and activities over time. Personal knowledge might include tips that help the employee work with or around deficit computer processes, or shortcuts that eliminate waste or improve efficiency. If Camilla did not provide these tips, it would likely take Cecily more time to become proficient at her job, which can affect the company's efficiency and ability to achieve its goals. Therefore, Camilla is behaving in an ethical manner by providing Cecily with tips and personal knowledge. Until Cecily gets acclimated with her job, she will not know if she has a better way to complete tasks than the way that Camilla suggests. There isn't evidence to indicate that Camilla would provide incorrect information."

A nondisclosure agreement is a contract between an employer and an employee that states that the employee will not reveal the employer's trade secrets (e.g., formula, recipe, manufacturing technique) to future employers for whom the employee might work. The purpose of a nondisclosure agreement is to provide businesses with legal protection if a competitor attempts to use revealed information for financial gain or benefit. Nondisclosure provisions or agreements are often part of the noncompete agreement, which is a contract between an employer and an employee that states that the employee will not work for a competitor for a certain length of time after leaving the company.

In communities of practice, group members share ideas, discuss problems, and brainstorm solutions. By doing so, the group members are transferring their knowledge among themselves. One or all members can capture and record the collected knowledge for future personal or group use. In the example, Jack and his friends share a common bond because all of them work in technology. When the group met, Jack's friends offered suggestions for resolving his work dilemma; therefore, the group is a community of practice. Groupthink is a situation that occurs when conforming to the group becomes more important than expressing individual judgment and ideas. A strategic alliance is an arrangement that involves two or more businesses entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources such as technology, skills, capital, or distribution channels for the benefit of all parties; the relationship is usually short-term or for a single project/transaction.

Businesses consider social trends, or changes in society and culture, so that they can remain sensitive to customer needs and wants. Businesses may also examine the general competition, brand competition, and substitute products during an environmental scan. Even within a private enterprise system, the government still affects business decision-making, so businesses often research changing laws and regulations, monetary and fiscal policies, import/export restrictions, etc. Lastly, businesses examine new developments in technology to determine challenges as well as opportunities that may result."

      "explanation": "Creates a variety of evaluative reports. Project management software has many applications and features that help businesspeople effectively manage both short- and long-term projects. One application of effective project management software is the ability to generate reports that summarize a variety of information, such as expenses, timing, and activity data. Some software can provide cost and variance analyses. Depending on the type of software being used, it may also allow users the ability to integrate word processing functions to create custom or free-format reports. Because data are entered manually, project management software cannot eliminate the coding problems related to human error. Project management software does not provide job training, nor does it reduce the need to monitor costs."

The parent company is able to pay its premiums to its own captive insurer to protect the company against particular forms of risk. There are a number of reasons that a company may form its own captive insurer, many of which are focused on lowering the costs of risk management. Professional liability insurance protects businesses against claims of negligence. While it may be covered by a captive insurer, it is most often covered by a third-party insurer. Medical malpractice insurance is a form of professional liability insurance. Compulsory insurance is a term for any type of insurance that is required by law."

      "explanation": "Deadline driven. Establishing and stating deadlines is one tactic that businesses often use when negotiating with vendors. By providing the vendor with specific deadlines (e.g., shipping orders within 24 hours of order placement), the business is making sure that its requests are met. Limited authority is a negotiation strategy in which one party claims that they do not have the authority to meet certain requests. Bargaining involves \u201cgive and-take\u201d tactics by both parties to reach an agreement.

Many aspects of operations are directly affected by environmental law, including location, supply chains, transportation, and manufacturing. Employment and labor laws also affect operations as they relate to regulations affecting human resources. Insurance law also touches many aspects including manufacturing processes and human resources management. Advertising regulation is unlikely to directly affect operations management. Antitrust laws may affect some aspects of supply chain management but also affect other areas of business management. Tax codes affect operations management only indirectly, if at all.

Profitability, for example, can be easily affected by a drop in material costs that are unrelated to any managerial decisions. These measures are also limited in that they are not useful in pinpointing issues in specific departments or units due to interdependence in the supply chain. Even though there are limits to these measures, they can still be useful when considered with other factors.

Local labor unions are good sources for job leads particularly for such industries as construction which usually hires seasonal workers. Many local unions operate some type of worker placement service for industries in their area. County offices, local merchants, and family friends probably would not have helpful information about the availability of seasonal jobs in the construction industry."

During that time, the project manager is highly involved in controlling activities, such as monitoring the work effort. While monitoring the work effort, the project manager may detect problems. Sometimes, processes, tasks, and budgets need to be changed or corrected. Therefore, the project manager may need to update the project plan when changes occur. The project manager develops the project charter during the initiation phase and, if necessary, forms a steering committee during the project-definition phase. The project's sponsors (stakeholders) would determine changes to their requirements and advise the project manager to implement the revisions."

Businesses commonly use risk modeling to quantify the potential losses that they would incur if certain events took place, such as a tornado destroying a company's largest manufacturing plant. Because risk modeling is a very complex process, businesses usually rely on risk-management technology to aid in the analyses and forecasts. Cost-benefit analysis involves quantifying the costs and benefits of a certain project to determine the most appropriate course of action to pursue. Risk transference is a risk-response strategy that involves moving the impact of a risk to someone or something else. In investing, fundamental analysis is the study of all aspects of a company in an effort to understand its intrinsic value."

The impact assessment should detail whom is most likely to be impacted by the change and what the anticipated effects of the change will be on these individuals. Businesses should wait to measure changes in employee behavior, implement corrective action plans, and recognize staff who have changed successfully until after the change has been initiated."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "They clearly outline both sides of an agreement. Legally binding contracts are meant to clearly outline an agreement. This way, disputes and litigation can hopefully be avoided. Legally binding contracts don't actually have to be written; they can still be valid if they're verbal, but they're much easier to prove if they are in writing. Breaking a contract doesn't always result in a lawsuit or jail time. In fact, most people avoid lawsuits at all costs since they tend to be expensive and lengthy. Contracts are only enforceable for legal acts."

By buying stock in an open corporation, John can become a business owner without daily involvement in the business. In addition, shareholders in an open corporation are only liable for the amount they invest in the company. Sole proprietorship is a form of ownership that requires owner participation. General partnership combines the capital, experience, and abilities of two or more people. Sole proprietorships and general partnerships involve unlimited liability. A close (private) corporation does not offer stock for sale to the general public. In many cases, the shareholders manage and operate the business, which means the owners participate in the day-to-day activities of the business."

      "explanation": "To prevent future problems. Individuals who are partners in a business should have a partnership agreement, even though it is not required by law, because it does help the partners prevent future problems. It should include such points as the rights, responsibilities, and contributions of each partner; the division of authority and profit for each partner; the length of the partnership agreement; and the actions to take if a partner dies or becomes unable to continue the business.

      "explanation": "Fraud. A tort is a private wrongdoing against another person. Businesses can be held responsible in a variety of torts. For example, suppose a business's employee intentionally provides misleading product information to a customer to make a sale. Then, the customer purchases and is injured by the product based on the employee's misleading information. The customer may file a civil lawsuit against the business, and in some situations, the business's employee for fraudulent behavior. Assault and intrusion are criminal acts that are addressed in the criminal court system rather than the civil court system. Defamation is a tort that involves harm to an individual's or business's reputation."

An industrial user is a business that buys materials, services, or goods that will be used to make other goods or used in the operation of the company. A construction company, for instance, must buy lumber, steel, and other materials needed to build homes and offices. An ultimate consumer, on the other hand, is anyone who personally uses a good or service to satisfy their own needs or wants. We are all ultimate consumers of many different goods and services.

Exclusive distribution would make this product less available to the everyday consumer, as in the case of upscale cars or clothing, and is impractical for this type of product. Inclusive distribution is not a recognized distribution strategy. Selective distribution is a balance between intensive and exclusive distribution, such as the sale of certain power tools only through one or two retailers, and like exclusive distribution, it is impractical for dishwashing soap."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "To use touchpoints to create positive customer experiences. The brand promise is a company's agreement (spoken or unspoken) with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand characteristics and values. To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand promise should strive to create positive experiences for customers\u2014experiences that will encourage them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touchpoints to create these experiences for their customers. Touchpoints are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touchpoints may include the company's employees, product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., phone, website). A slogan (tag line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as \"Nationwide is on your side.\" A trade character is a symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition. One reason that businesses establish certain types of policies (e.g., sales, service) is to ensure that customers are treated fairly. Establishing different policies for different customers is not treating customers fairly, and in some circumstances, such actions are illegal."

The law of diminishing returns indicates that as more and more units of an input are added to production, the per person output decreases.

      "question": "A small-business owner is trying to decide whether to rent or buy office furniture. The monthly rental is $275 per person, and there are six people who will need furniture. The cost of buying the furniture is $6,500 per person. What would you advise the small-business owner to do?",
      "options": [
        "Buy the furniture because rental costs will be less than the purchase price in 2.2 years.",
        "Buy the furniture because rental costs will exceed the purchase price in 1.97 years.",
        "Rent the furniture because rental costs are much less a year than the purchase price on an annual basis.",
        "Rent the furniture because rental costs will be less than the purchase price for 3.4 years."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Buy the furniture because rental costs will exceed the purchase price in 1.97 years. To determine whether to rent or buy office furniture, the small-business owner needs to first calculate the annual cost of renting the furniture. To do this, multiply the monthly rate of $275 by the number of employees needing furniture (6). This provides the total monthly rental expense: $275 X 6 = $1,650. Next, multiply the total monthly rental expense by 12, the number of months in a year: $1,650 X 12 = $19,800. Now, determine how much the small-business owner would pay if they bought the furniture. Multiply the furniture cost per person by the number of people needing furniture: $6,500 X 6 = $39,000. Finally, divide the furniture's total cost by the annual rental rate to determine how many years it would take for the cost of the rented furniture to exceed the cost of the purchased furniture: $39,000 / $19,800 = 1.97 years. In a little less than two years, the cost of the rental furniture will exceed the cost of the purchased furniture. If the small-business owner has the money, it would be worthwhile for them to buy rather than rent the office furniture."

When international customers discover and enjoy that new business's products, sales often increase. A business operating in several different countries will have more cultural barriers to deal with because customer preferences, traditions, and trends vary from country to country. When a business operates in many countries, it faces more compliance challenges since it must deal with a greater number of and more types of regulations imposed by different countries (e.g., ingredients and packaging used for products). Business expansion into international markets exposes a business to more financial risk since different currencies, tariffs, and shipping fees often reduce profits."

Common-sized statements use percentages for the purposes of comparing one company to another within an industry or one company to overall industry averages. Percentages are used for comparison purposes because the relative sizes of companies can make it difficult to use dollar figures, for example. Horizontal analysis is also used for comparison, but it is most often used to compare the same pieces of information as they have changed from one period to another within a single company. Percentages are also often used in vertical analysis, but they are used to show what percentage of a general category is made up of a single item (e.g., what percentage of total assets are long-term assets). These percentages can then be compared across time but are not as often used to compare businesses to one another. Trend analysis is a method that uses data from the past to predict future data.

      "explanation": "$295,925. Businesses often forecast sales in dollar amounts. In this example, the business currently has a 30% share of the market but expects to obtain an additional 5% next year. Therefore, next year's market share is expected to be 35% of an $845,500 market. To calculate that amount, multiply the dollar value of the market by the market share ($845,500 X 35% [or .35] = $295,925)."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "They want to understand more about their customers' interests, activities, and concerns. The more advertisers know about their customers, the more they can effectively target their audiences. Advertisers go beyond demographic information and are continually trying to find ways to learn more behavioral information about their customers. Having increasingly large amounts of information about customers makes record keeping a greater challenge, necessitating the use of databases. Some advertisers sell customer information to other companies, but an increasing number recognize this practice as an invasion of their customers' privacy. Most companies of any size will not be able to recognize each and every one of their customers. The best they can do is to understand various groups of customers in terms of their behavior, interests, and preferences."

      "explanation": "What software programs will help the business operate efficiently? The type of business influences the venture's technological needs. The technology (e.g., computer software) the business selects should help the business run efficiently. For example, a medical office needs different types of computer programs to maintain and store business information than a carpet-cleaning business. After the business owner determines the type of computer programs the venture needs, they can research vendors, costs, etc. Regardless of the type of business the owner is running, they will always need to maintain computer hardware to run the programs. The business doesn't legally structure the technology department differently from the rest of the business."

The goal here is to allow observable data to naturally collect into groups that are largely homogenous, share a set of characteristics, and are unlike the data in other groups or clusters. These clusters, when used to sort consumers, create market segments that can be targeted with marketing. Market basket analysis focuses on establishing links between data points that tend to occur together. This is often used in determining which items tend to be purchased together (placed in a \u201cmarket basket\u201d together). Prediction analysis, such as regression analysis, involves using independent or predictor variables to anticipate a response of a dependent variable. Forecasting analysis seeks to make predictions about specific time periods based on historical observations and other considerations."

In the event that a fire breaks out, employees should be able to find the extinguishers quickly and attempt to put out the fire while another employee calls the fire department. Knowing where the fire extinguishers are and reacting quickly often prevents a fire from spreading and reduces the amount of damage. Fire-prevention programs do not require employees to know the location of all electrical outlets or hazardous materials. Employees should have easy access to the phone numbers of emergency services, rather than knowing the location of those services."

      "explanation": "Pay a $2,000 security deposit to lease a facility. Many new businesses have limited amounts of cash available to cover the costs of purchasing property, which usually include a down payment, closing costs, taxes, etc. On the other hand, the initial cash expense for leasing is often limited to a security deposit and the first rent payment. When cash is limited, it is usually more economical for new businesses to pay a $2,000 security deposit to lease rather than buy a facility because it saves them money. If businesses have sufficient cash, it is more economical in the long run to negotiate a 9.5% interest rate and make a $50,000 down payment to buy rather than lease. Paying a year's rent in advance is not economical for a business that has limited cash flow."

Businesses analyze financial data to evaluate the financial well-being of their operations at any given time. By comparing the same type of financial information from different consecutive time periods, a business can detect trends. By detecting trends, the business can determine if it needs to make changes. For example, if the business notices a substantial increase in sales-dollar volume over a three-month period, trends indicate an increase in spending. The business may decide to conduct further analysis to determine what customers are purchasing, and decide if it needs to increase the production or inventory levels of certain products. Businesses analyze markets for many reasons, but they cannot control market activity. To analyze its competitors, a business needs to obtain and review external data. Comparing internal financial data cannot influence buying behavior."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Final customers who buy the supply chain's end product. The sales revenue generated by customers purchasing a supply chain's end product is the only true income source for an entire supply chain. As a result, customer satisfaction is one of the most important factors in supply chain management. Profit generated from purchases made within the supply chain does not add income to the supply chain. The only source for any money that is generated through participation in a supply chain must come from the ultimate sale of the end product. Without this sale, no supply chain member will be able to receive revenues. Raw materials used in manufacturing play into the expenses side of the supply chain, but there are more expenses than just the raw materials. Because the only revenue created must come from the final customer, many aspects of supply chain management involve limiting expenses up to the point where the customers' expectations for the final product are still being met, but not beyond. Neither investments nor loans are commonly considered income for a business."

Process thinking means keeping processes in mind throughout a project or business venture. Process thinking helps organizations know why they succeeded or failed because they can look back at and assess the process that was used, which is usually the cause of success or failure. Process thinking does not enable organizations to find out who to blame for issues, because it shifts the focus from people to processes.

Expansion occurs when a business expands its product mix by adding additional product items or lines. When a company decides to add a higher-priced product or line to its mix, it is using a trading-up strategy."

To determine the level of excellence of a specific service that it offers, a business uses service standards. A service standard is a specification or statement that is used as a basis for comparing or judging a service. Internal service standards are standards the business develops for itself. External standards are those that are defined by external sources, such as the industry or the customer. Because the business in the situation expects its own employees to respond to phone requests within a set time frame, the expectation is a company-defined standard. The situation does not represent a customer-defined service goal, customer-defined technical expectation, or a company-defined technical audit. An audit is a review of a business activity, which is often conducted by independent consultants."

To do this, businesses use a variety of public relations activities to communicate with the public and provide positive information. Creative thinking is thinking in a creative way, using the creative-thinking process. Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analyzing of data about problems relating to the marketing of goods and services.

If one of those goals is to increase customer satisfaction by 15%, an effective measure of progress toward that goal is the number of product returns. As the business increases its customers' satisfaction with its goods and services, the number of product returns should decrease\u2014because satisfied customers are happy with their purchases and less likely to return or exchange the items. Although increased marketing efforts, more touchpoints, and less employee turnover may increase customer satisfaction, they are not effective measures of the resulting customer satisfaction."

For example, sole proprietorships are taxed as individuals and have little government regulation, while public corporations are subject to dual taxation and more government regulation. The nature of a business might influence the business structure, but the selection of a business structure does not influence the nature (type) of the business. Not all business structures issue stock. With the proper resources, any business structure can expand internationally. Business structures can affect owner control, but do not necessarily affect the international tariffs that are paid. Tariffs are generally determined by individual countries or governments."

One of the legal reasons for dismissing employees is a change in the requirements of the job. If the nature of a job changes significantly and an employee is incapable of doing the work, a business may dismiss the employee. Also, businesses may dismiss employees if their jobs are eliminated. However, most businesses try to retrain employees if at all possible rather than dismiss them. A conflict of personality or a permanent physical disability are not legally acceptable reasons for dismissing employees. It is no longer possible for businesses to dismiss employees simply because they do not have a signed contract; the business must have a legitimate reason."

      "explanation": "Identify and resolve problems. One reason for producers to evaluate the performance of their distribution channel members is to identify problems related to moving products. Once they identify problems, the producers can work with the channel members to resolve them. If the producers and channel members cannot resolve problems, the producers may decide to look for other intermediaries. Evaluating the channel members' performance does not always create channel conflict; in fact, sometimes the process reduces conflict. Producers do not evaluate channel members for the purposes of developing new products or reducing communication."

Setting and accomplishing goals help you work toward your vision. Some of those goals may include getting others to embrace your vision and help you carry it out. Enlisting others' support can be done in a variety of ways, one of which is to appeal to their emotions by sharing stories. The leaders often share inspirational stories about people who have overcome difficult circumstances, or they may share tragic stories about situations that do not need to happen or should not exist. Using logic involves appealing to the mind rather than to the emotions. Providing procedures and insisting on immediate action may not appeal to others' emotions and encourage them to commit to a shared vision."

Sharing content on social media helps show the businesses that Julio is willing to promote their content to others. In exchange, those businesses will be more likely to promote Julio's content in the future. Persistently asking those business owners to invest in his company might irritate the business owners and tarnish Julio's relationships with them. Attending trade shows and conferences to make new connections is a great way to build new relationships, but not necessarily to leverage existing relationships.

Entrepreneurial discovery is the process of detecting and matching product and market opportunities with one another in a manner that satisfies the market and the business. Sometimes there is a market with a demand for something that is not available, and the business invents a product to satisfy the demand. For example, a scientist uses existing physical elements to develop a new vaccine to prevent a certain disease for which there is no treatment. Because the vaccine is new, the scientist (inventor) is observing and applying knowledge in a specific way, or using a scientific process.

      "explanation": "Inside-out. An inside-out analysis involves looking at internal abilities and resources to identify venture and product opportunities. A new entrepreneur may first look at their personal abilities and resources to determine what type of business might be best for them. Landon may have started a furniture business because he was a good carpenter. Today, Landon's business is larger and has more resources, so he may determine that he has the capabilities within his business to add interior decorating or design services. Another approach to determining venture and product opportunities is by conducting an outside-in analysis. In this situation, the entrepreneur looks at external factors, such as unmet market needs, to identify opportunities. Competition and culture are other external considerations that entrepreneurs consider when identifying venture and product opportunities."

Brainstorming is a creative-thinking technique that involves the identification of as many different ideas as possible during a certain time frame. Brainstorming is an activity that can be done individually or in groups. The disadvantage of brainstorming by yourself is that you are not exposed to others' ideas or viewpoints, which limits input to your own thoughts and views. The advantage to brainstorming on your own is that you have the flexibility to brainstorm whenever and wherever it is convenient for you\u2014while traveling, in the evening at home, etc. Another advantage to brainstorming alone is that others are not around to evaluate or criticize your ideas."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Establishing best practices and communicating them throughout the organization. Business process design involves developing a business practice where one did not previously exist. It benefits organizations by establishing a process that can be followed by each member of the organization, thereby eliminating guesswork. Establishing a business process design also allows for the communication of the tasks in a project throughout an organization to help ensure that each task is performed the same way and in the appropriate order. This eliminates the reliance on veteran employees' prior knowledge or the pressure of hiring employees who have the knowledge or strengths that allow them to perform the tasks without a specific process in place. While business processes should be routinely evaluated for the possibility of improvement, process design approaches a business process as a series of steps with an end result in mind as opposed to working backwards from a defective product and eliminating possible problems along the way."

Becoming a business consultant will not necessarily help Bethany make informed, intelligent decisions for her entrepreneurial venture.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Increases the deductible from $500 to $1,000. The deductible is the amount of loss that a business is willing to accept before the insurance company pays the remainder. As a rule, the premium becomes smaller as the deductible becomes larger. For example, the premium costs for a business with a $1,000 deductible will be less than for a business with a $500 deductible because the first business is willing to pay for more of the loss. Paying the premium in monthly installments and purchasing the insurance from a private agent will not reduce the amount of the premium. Businesses do not pay a security deposit when they buy insurance."

When a company expects higher sales, it needs to increase its outputs and, therefore, needs more inputs (e.g., personnel) to satisfy the higher product demand. Business owners do not need to obtain government application forms to hire employees. The business owner may not ask current employees to increase their workloads, because they may not have the necessary skills to perform the job. The business owner does not need to limit other employees' hours before deciding to hire another salesperson."

To obtain more in-depth information about the applicant, the interviewer should ask open-ended questions\u2014questions that require more than a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Asking applicants about the activities that they perform in their current jobs forces them to respond with more than a yes or a no; therefore, the interviewer is likely to get more in-depth information from applicants. Asking an applicant if they have a college degree, how long the applicant has worked for their current employer, and when the applicant is available to start work are examples of closed-end questions. Closed-end questions require short, precise answers and do not provide in-depth information."

      "explanation": "Jeopardizes coworkers. Termination for cause occurs when an employee's conduct seriously violates company policies or jeopardizes the company or other employees. An example is an employee who harasses others or who threatens others. This person is creating an environment at work that may be harmful or dangerous to coworkers. As a result, the business has a legitimate cause to terminate the employee. It is usually illegal to fire an employee for being a whistle-blower. Businesses usually do not terminate employees for refusing promotions or those who need additional training. Businesses usually provide training when necessary so employees can perform as expected."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The company does not have time to conduct the research. The most common reason a company hires an outside research firm is because it does not have the time required to conduct the research. Since research needs to be unbiased to be valid, it's not likely a company would desire biased results. Research costs time and money to conduct regardless of who conducts it. If the company has access to abundant internal and external data, it's less likely to require an outside research firm."

For instance, if marketers are planning to develop a new product, they will create a budget, estimating how much money they'll need to complete each step of the development process. Facts are data that can be verified. There's no disputing that a fact is true. However, budgets do not contain facts, because they are used to make predictions and estimates about the future\u2014and nobody knows exactly what the future holds! The data in budgets are not goals, since a business's goals may differ wildly from the organization's actual expected needs or requirements. Budget information should not be false."

A tactic is a specific activity that a business implements to carry out a strategy. Place is the element of the marketing mix that involves getting the selected product in the right place at the right time. Morrison is selling snack foods to Quickster, which is a specific action that makes the products accessible to and convenient for the customer. Therefore, the company is using a tactic to achieve goals related to the place element of the marketing mix.

      "explanation": "What resources do we lack? A SWOT analysis is a marketing tool that investigates a business's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Conducting a SWOT analysis helps a business determine what it is doing well and where it needs to improve. When examining the business's weaknesses, it should ask itself what resources it lacks. When a business lacks certain resources, it cannot operate efficiently, which reduces its ability to effectively compete in the marketplace. Therefore, it is important for the business to objectively look at its resource shortages and take steps to improve the situation. When the business asks a question about its competitors' activities, it is seeking information about a threat. When a business asks a question about particular markets the competitors have missed, it is examining opportunities. The assets, or things of value that a business has, are its strengths."

Businesses set many types of marketing objectives including sales, advertising, pricing, product development, etc. After setting its marketing objectives, a business uses them to measure the success or performance of its marketing activities. To determine the success of marketing activities, the business should set specific, measurable objectives that are tied to a time frame, such as increasing sales of product X by 20% in the next three months. The marketing objectives should be compatible with the company's overall goals, and they should be challenging but achievable and flexible.

To develop an accurate client profile, brokerage houses need to determine if their clients are well-informed about financial products or if they are new buyers. This is important because the way brokerage houses market their products will depend on the knowledge level of their clients. If clients are unfamiliar with stocks and bonds, brokerage houses will need to spend more time educating their clients in order to make a sale. On the other hand, knowledgeable clients who understand the products might need a different type of assistance. Information about a customer's social background, political preference, and intelligence level would be difficult to obtain and not necessarily helpful in developing a profile."

The impact of demographics (the age of the population) on a specific industry (health care) shows that businesses have unique relationships with their environments. The aging of the population affects other industries, but perhaps not as directly as it does health care.

Businesses develop safety policies, which are guidelines that employees follow to reduce the risk of injury in the workplace. Safety policies vary by industry and business, but the purpose of the policies is to keep employees safe while on the job. For example, a business might require employees to wear protective headgear when they are working in a warehouse or in dangerous areas where items or debris may fall from high shelves. Businesses should keep aisles clear of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of falls, which can cause injuries. Exit doors should always be accessible so employees can vacate the building if an emergency (e.g., fire) occurs.

An intermittent production system is shut down from time to time for various reasons, such as a decline in demand or an oversupply of stock.

It is important for a business's management team to monitor all aspects of the business so it can maintain or exceed the quality level that its customers expect. If quality decreases, the business may lose customers to its competitors. An important part of monitoring quality is soliciting input from the workers who are actually performing the tasks, because they often have ideas that will help them do their jobs with more efficiency. Ongoing communication is necessary for continuous quality improvement because unexpected issues might occur that affect quality, and management needs to know so the problems can be fixed. Continuous quality improvement usually occurs in small increments over time. The number of changes is dependent on the business's goals. It is not always necessary to hire additional staff to oversee quality control programs. The frequency of reports that management requires is dependent on the business's needs, objectives, and procedures."

      "explanation": "To protect employees. Businesses have a responsibility to provide employees with safe working conditions. To do this, businesses need to identify potential safety issues and take steps to correct problems if necessary. Businesses are often able to protect employees from injury by identifying problem areas and making them safe. It is not possible to completely eliminate accidents. Identifying potential safety issues will not avoid violence or establish security."

Once the company has documented its need, it can then move on to identifying potential vendors, holding discussions with potential vendors, and eliminating vendors that don't meet the organization's standards. It would be unwise to take any of these steps without first determining why the company needs the vendor."

In many situations, comparing data from one period with similar data from another period will help a company determine if it is accomplishing its goals or if it needs to make adjustments to accomplish its goals.

Entrepreneurs should avoid hiring employees unless they are needed for business activities that will help produce revenue such as marketing and production activities. Since the early stages of a venture produce little revenue, there is no money to save and no money to pay employees with. It's better for an entrepreneur to pay an expert or business coach for advice instead of hiring one as an employee.

      "explanation": "BPR assumes that processes are the main cause of poor performance. Business process redesign is based on the notion that better processes will lead directly to better performance. This approach has the potential to blame processes for poor performance from other causes. This can be especially problematic when BPR leads to layoffs or significant disruptions that can either obscure the true cause of the performance or lead to further performance problems. BPR should be considered as one option for improving performance and not the only option. BPR is said to focus too much on efficiency and cost reduction as opposed to employee satisfaction or customer happiness. It also tends to assume that costs are one of the most important aspects of efficient production."

      "explanation": "If a business's supply chain is poorly managed, customer satisfaction is likely to suffer. A business's supply chain has a large impact on the business's overall success. One of the ways that poor supply chain management can negatively impact a business is through decreasing customer satisfaction. Companies that can't effectively distribute their products to consumers will likely lose many of their customers. Effective supply chain management, on the other hand, generally results in higher customer satisfaction because products are distributed quickly and effectively.

A free-standing insert is an advertising leaflet or brochure that is inserted into a magazine, newspaper, or other publication. A product demonstration involves showing customers how a product works, generally in a retail setting. Business-to-business promotion is any promotional effort directed from one business toward another."

      "explanation": "Media kit. The public relations function involves establishing good relationships between the business and the public. A business tries to maintain positive relationships with different groups that make up the public, such as employees, shareholders, local businesses, government officials, and the media. It is important for a business to build positive relationships with the media because they have access to large groups of people through the airwaves and their publications. Often, a business provides newspaper and magazine publishers and television and radio stations with media kits that provide information about the business and its employees. It is the business's goal that the media will air or publish news stories that portray the business in a favorable way, which provides positive publicity. The public relations director did not develop a sponsorship program, creative brief, or advertising profile."

One way for a business to build goodwill with the community is by participating in charitable events. This might involve providing financial support, goods (e.g., energy bars), or volunteers for the event. A media blitz is an intense effort to communicate information through all possible channels.

A product recall is the removal from the marketplace of a product that is defective or hazardous to consumers. Defective brake pads can cause car accidents and serious injuries. Therefore, the manufacturer needs to fix or replace the cars to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries. Customization is the process of producing a product with special specifications. Customer preferences are a customer's specific wants. Adaptability is the ability to adjust to changing conditions. The example is not a quality-management issue related to customization, customer preferences, or adaptability."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Having clearly stated business objectives makes it easier to identify the actual importance of specific risks. Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential risks so they can be effectively managed. When a company's business objectives are clearly stated, it is easier to identify how important a specific risk is. Achieving a desired amount of profit is dependent on many factors and is not achieved solely by identifying risk or developing clearly stated business objectives. Developing clearly stated business objectives is just one activity involved in designing an overall risk management strategy. An overall risk management strategy is a complex and strategic business management tool that has many important components (e.g., risk assessment matrix analysis and formal contingency plans) to reduce actual risks. Since business risks are an inherent part of conducting business, it is impossible to eliminate them\u2014no matter how clearly stated the company's business objectives are."

Most businesses have a variety of systems and procedures that are vital to the operation of the business. It is important to analyze them to make sure they are operating according to expectations.

An ethical manager does not discuss an employee's confidential information (e.g., health issues, personal problems, performance reviews, salary) with other employees. Discussing an employee's personal matters with others usually leads to distrust and morale problems among the company's employees. Linda is not necessarily expressing favoritism toward Ken if she gives other employees higher salary increases than she gives Ken.

      "explanation": "1.5 less. Calculate the inventory turnover rate by dividing the number of widgets sold by the number in stock (550,000 / 220,000 = 2.5). The 2.5 figure indicates that the business turns its inventory two-and-a-half times a year. If the industry average is four times a year, the business's turnover rate is 1.5 less than the average (4.0 - 2.5 = 1.5).

A pyramid scheme is an illegal form of multi-level marketing in which emphasis is placed on collecting initial fees from as many people as possible.

Developing, implementing, communicating, and adhering to a customer privacy policy is one way to build the customers' trust. Privacy policies might include limiting the access that employees have to customer information and not selling customer lists to third parties. By respecting their customers' privacy, businesses can earn and maintain their customers' trust. Laws require businesses to maintain certain information about their customers' transactions for specified timeframes. Sending opt-in email messages to customers is helpful in maintaining relationships with customers; however, sending them too frequently, such as every day, may be annoying to some customers."

Operations managers might use a financial-information management system to determine operating efficiency, manage inventory, or evaluate key suppliers. Although technology is an integral part of the financial-information management function, it is not the only part. The financial-information management function involves people, processes, and equipment/technology. Due to increased compliance requirements, the financial-information management function's responsibilities have increased in recent years. Much more data must be maintained by the financial-information management system for longer periods of time as a result of new laws and regulations. Data in a financial-information management system should be current. In many situations, decision makers need to know what is happening right now, not what happened months or even years ago."

      "explanation": "On the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). Very small companies that don't meet organized exchange listing requirements as well as companies with poor credit ratings are likely to trade their stock on the OTCBB. The OTCBB is a regulated electronic exchange with no listing requirements. Therefore, stocks traded on the OTCBB are likely to be riskier investments than stocks traded on organized exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange. The American Stock Exchange is an organized exchange which became the NYSE Amex Equities in 2009. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp"

This type of tax is called a luxury tax. An individual who receives a certain amount of money as a gift may be required to pay a gift tax. Property taxes are paid on buildings (e.g., homes) and land.

In the example, the company entrusted Oscar with placing the company's money in one account, and instead, Oscar put the money in a bank account that only he had access to. Oscar was stealing money from the company. Insider trading involves leaking information to others that is not known to the public.

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Remain steady throughout all phases. The business cycle affects the stock prices of various industries in different ways. The demand for the products of non-cyclical industries (e.g., food, beverage, tobacco, healthcare) tends to remain consistent throughout all phases of the business cycle. Therefore, the stock performance of non-cyclical industries tends to remain steady throughout all stages of the business cycle, as well. Changes in the business cycle tend to affect the stock prices of other industries, including energy and capital goods. The energy sector (e.g., oil) is affected by the global supply and demand, which influences energy stock performance. Historically, energy stocks tend to perform best late in the business cycle. Capital goods stocks tend to perform well during the expansion phase of the business cycle because businesses are expanding and buying equipment."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Unstable stock markets in a transitional economy. Emerging markets are growing markets (e.g., stock, bond, commodities, etc.) that result when a country initiates reforms that move it from a closed economy to an open or market economy. Because the markets are new, they are untried and relatively unstable, which is a high risk for investors. However, these markets also have the potential to provide investors with high returns, as the country's business activity increases and its economy grows. Developing countries tend to experience gains in gross domestic product due to higher production and business activity, which is often facilitated by high foreign investment. The infrastructure of developing countries often improves when the government and investors provide the financial resources to support it."

      "explanation": "Investors. The statement of changes in equity is a financial statement that specifically looks at the changes to the owners' equity over time. It gives the clearest picture of how invested wealth has grown, changed, or contributed to a business. Because of the specific focus on wealth, it is most useful to the investors of the business who have an interest in seeing the effect of business operations on their investments.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "They are subtracted from the net income. Since dividends paid to stockholders are taken from net income earned, they are subtracted from the net income on the statement of stockholders' equity. Since dividends paid reduce a company's profits, they are not added to net income. Dividends are listed as an actual cash amount, not a percentage, on the statement. It is not possible to correctly calculate a company's stockholders' equity by simply listing dividends paid."

      "explanation": "Purchase price. A variance is the difference between an established standard and the actual outcome. It is important for a business to monitor variances in the price of raw materials because they affect its bottom line. When a vendor increases the prices that it charges for raw materials, it costs the business (manufacturer) more money to produce an item. The business may need to find a vendor that charges less for the materials or parts, or it may need to increase its selling price\u2014the amount that the business charges its customers for the finished good. Fixed overhead costs are expenses that do not change in relation to changes in sales volume and include things such as rent and employee salaries.

Random access memory (RAM) is the computer's short-term memory responsible for storing information needed by software applications that are currently in use. The number of applications that a computer can run at once depends a great deal on the amount of RAM that the computer has. A computer with a lot of RAM can run several applications at once, while a computer with little RAM can run a much more limited number of programs at the same time. The central processing unit (CPU) is the brains of the computer\u2014it performs calculations and tasks that allow software to function properly.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Whistleblower. One way to manage potential risks resulting from unethical conduct is to build an internal infrastructure that promotes and enforces ethical practices and offers incentives to behave ethically. This internal infrastructure typically includes appropriate audit procedures, a code of conduct, a committee to develop the code, training for employees about the code, and a whistleblower policy. A whistleblower policy encourages and enables employees to report unethical behavior or actions without fear of negative repercussions such as demotion or firing. A credit policy is a guideline for a business to follow in controlling the use of payment plans that allow customers to purchase now and pay later. Monetary policy is the government policy that determines the amount of money that will be in circulation and the level of interest rates. Constituent policies are public policies that apply to the government or nation as a whole. Constituent policies include national security, foreign affairs, diplomacy, etc."

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and limiting of business losses and enhancing possibilities for gain. Ethics and risk management rely on one another because managing risks is ethical and unethical behavior is risky. However, ethics are not the same as risk management. Risk management does not prevent ethical behavior; rather, it encourages it. Risk management is not generally unethical."

Businesses use technology to minimize security risks. One way that businesses control security risks is by installing firewalls on computer networks to prevent computer hackers from obtaining confidential financial data (e.g., customers' credit card numbers). Natural disasters include occurrences such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. Physical safety risks involve threats to a person's well-being and may include environmental hazards such as air pollution and water toxins."

Job rotation is an effective management training method to broaden the employees' perspective of the business. Rotating jobs and responsibilities can benefit employees and increase their morale because they are learning new skills. It also keeps employees from becoming bored because they are doing different tasks. Job rotation benefits businesses because employees are cross-trained and can serve as backup resources. Interdependency occurs when workers must rely on each other to accomplish a task or produce a product. Job security is the likelihood that an employee will be able to keep their job.

By offering their products in other countries, businesses are able to reach new markets to which they have not previously been able to sell their products. Using international markets as a dumping ground for obsolete, outdated products would be a short-term strategy that would eventually create a negative company image. Governments may subsidize developing countries; businesses do not. Although people in other countries may gain employment, that is not a reason for a company to offer its products in other countries."

Economic factors relate to how people generate revenue to obtain the desired goods and services. Government stability and laws are political factors that operate in the business environment.

In this case, Anna's boss did not treat her fairly, so they did not develop a relationship of respect and trust. Therefore, Anna looked for a different job.

Health insurance covers such medical expenses as hospital bills, doctors' fees, lab charges, and other medical costs.

The borrower pays back the mortgage or loan with interest. Charging and collecting interest is the way that the financial institution makes money by providing the loan. Government bonds are debt instruments because the organizations or individuals who purchase the bonds (asset providers) earn interest (income) on the bond from the bond issuer (government).

Tactical planning is short-range planning (one year) of specific actions the business will take. Two businesses should look much further ahead than just one year before making the decision to merge.

Before offering credit to a prospective customer, the business needs to analyze the customer's financial status to determine if the customer has the money available to make payments on time and in the full amount of the agreement. Businesses review the customer's income, assets, debt ratio, credit history, etc. If the customer's financial status meets the business's credit standards, then a credit arrangement is a viable option. If the customer carries high debt in relation to assets, it would be too risky for the business to offer credit because the customer is more likely to become delinquent. The business does not analyze risks related to its own accounting processes or reporting strategies. A beneficiary is a person who receives benefits, most often money, from another person. For example, a beneficiary of a life insurance policy receives money upon the insured's death."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation. According to most analysts, the three economic indicators that impact the stock market the most (and, therefore, the three that stock market investors and traders should pay the closest attention to) are the gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation. The gross domestic product (GDP) is the final market value of the total output of all goods and services produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's time. The stock market mirrors the GDP\u2014if the GDP goes up, the stock market usually goes up with it. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the workforce that is unemployed. The stock market is inversely related to the unemployment rate\u2014if the unemployment rate goes up, stock prices usually go down. Inflation is a rise in prices that may occur when demand exceeds supply or when productivity declines and costs of labor go up. If inflation and interest rates both rise, the stock market will suffer. However, if inflation goes up while interest rates stay low, the stock market is likely to benefit. Overhead expenses and bond rates are not economic indicators."

      "explanation": "Stock prices decrease. A country's stock market usually reflects the economic condition of its overall economy. During a recession, stock prices tend to decrease in value because investors are more likely to sell stock because they expect lower profits and the potential for firms to go bankrupt. A recession does not typically lead to a stock market crash. A stock market recovery is an indicator that the country is coming out of a recession."

Liberalization and financial product innovation (rather than investor innovation) are factors that have fueled the movement to financial globalization.

Marginal analysis helps companies make decisions that optimize resource use and maximize profits. It helps them select the best financial option. However, marginal analysis is not always suited for long-term decisions; rather, it is better suited for short-term decision-making.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Financial companies often enjoy higher earnings as a result of convergence and consolidation. Convergence within the finance industry typically involves financial providers from different financial sectors merging, such as a retail bank merging with an insurance company. Consolidation takes place when financial providers within the same institutional category merge, such as a retail bank merging with another retail bank. Some of the factors leading to convergence and consolidation in the finance industry are technology, liquidity constraints, a desire for increased profitability, and a desire for lower costs. Technological advancements have reduced the costs of offering new and different financial products. The convergence/consolidation of multiple financial companies usually results in more liquid capital to invest or to offer as loans for all companies involved. By merging, some financial firms (especially those converging with others within their financial sector) can achieve economies of scale, which result in reduced redundancy and lower costs for all involved.

Then, the market calls the lowest bidder to place an order. This is a simple process that reduces the need for a lot of paperwork. Also, orders can be placed quickly. Formal buying methods require more paperwork and usually written quotes rather than verbal quotes over the phone.

Employees who are responsible for paying the business's bills should make sure that payment is made on time so that the business saves the amount of the discount. Paying all bills as soon as they are received would not help control expenses since some bills have an extended payment period of 60 or 90 days. The business can use its money in other ways during the extended payment period. Buyers try to negotiate the most favorable dating terms with vendors at the time of purchase, not when the bills are due. Trade credit is credit granted by suppliers when they allow businesses an extended period of time in which to pay for goods."

The more clearly policies are laid out, the easier it is to handle any disputes that may arise with company property without conflict. Allowing minor misuse of company property may be a company-wide policy, but it does not necessarily prevent conflict, because it may become difficult to know what is acceptable and what is not. Likewise, enacting a zero-tolerance policy will not necessarily prevent conflict, because it does not account for accidental or minute infractions. Employees may not feel that they are being treated fairly, because they are being held to impossibly high standards. Finally, while appointing an employee to handle conflicts is a good practice, it does not necessarily help avoid conflict in the first place."

      "explanation": "Lower cost due to reduced inventory. Collaborating within a supply chain can reduce the amount of inventory a company needs to carry, which reduces inventory, storage, and transportation costs. Lower cost is not achieved with higher inventory. A company benefits from more flexibility\u2014not less\u2014when it collaborates with its supply chain because doing so gives the company access to more resources and helps it develop stronger supplier relationships. When supply chain collaboration is effective, it can increase a company's profits, but increased profits are an indirect, not direct, benefit."

ERM sends a strong signal to shareholders that the organization is taking risk management seriously. ERM can provide assurance to management, the board of directors, and shareholders that all possible steps are being taken to manage and prevent risk. Improved sales and decreased expenses in public relations are not guaranteed when implementing ERM. Ideally, ERM would result in less performance variability\u2014meaning that the organization's performance would remain consistently high."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "An intentional tort. A tort is a private wrongdoing against a person or business. When a tort is intentional, one party plans to carry out an activity against another party. Because advertising is a planned promotional activity, the use of overly aggressively advertising tactics is an intentional action. BTA used advertising to discredit MZT, which hurt MZT's sales. In response, MZT may file a lawsuit against BTA on the grounds of defamation, if the advertising contained false statements. Negligence involves unintentional or accidental wrongdoings such as a distracted driver causing a minor car accident. Misappropriation or embezzlement is the theft of valuables that have been entrusted to someone's care. In business, this usually involves money. Criminal law addresses issues that involve wrongdoing against society, such as robbery and murder."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It is legal for an airline to overbook a flight. Since there are no laws preventing airlines from overbooking flights, bumping passengers from flights is common when traveling by air. Several transportation agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Canadian Transportation Agency, among others, require that airlines first ask for volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for compensation. This may be in the form of cash or a voucher. The amount a passenger is compensated for lost luggage is subject to negotiation. Most airlines have a ceiling on the amount paid. Currently, there is no international \"Bill of Rights.\u201d However, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Transportation expanded its airline passenger protections to better safeguard passengers from lost baggage fees, overbooked flights, and hidden airline fees. Airlines are not required to pay any compensation for flight delays due to bad weather."

Listening does not happen automatically, because you have to concentrate to understand the meaning of the sounds and words you hear.

When making an oral presentation to a group, the speaker should speak loudly enough for everyone in the audience to hear what they are saying. If audience members cannot hear what the speaker is saying, they might misunderstand or misinterpret the message. A speaker should try not to turn away from the audience when presenting visual aids and should maintain eye contact with the audience. Because swaying back and forth can distract the audience, the speaker should avoid this type of movement."

The question was about the area's crime rate, which was relevant to the topic at hand. Jeff's question was a close-ended inquiry because it required the message recipient to provide a response in one of two ways\u201410% or 15%.

Knowledge of where products are kept in a business helps employees provide efficient service to customers who are looking for specific items. Employees can locate products for customers or direct customers to the right location. In a large business, the sales staff cannot be informed about all products that are in stock.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Alert guests that their tables are ready via text message. When restaurants are busy, it is important to keep customers entertained to improve their experience. One way to do so is to alert them via text message that their table is ready. That way, customers do not have to sit and wait\u2014they can explore the surrounding area, run errands, etc. Providing discounts to guests who wait over 30 minutes is a good customer service policy, but it will not necessarily help keep customers from becoming impatient while they wait, because they will not receive the discount until they have already eaten. Determining which aspect of the restaurant's operations is slow can help improve wait times in the long run, but it will not keep customers from becoming impatient while they wait. Finally, checking reviews to see how customers feel about the wait time is a good way to improve customer service, but it will not help keep customers from becoming impatient while they wait."

One way that employees can create positive moments of truth is to demonstrate empathy and concern when customers are experiencing frustration. Customers who feel that the company cares about them will be more likely to form a positive impression. A customer-satisfaction survey will not necessarily create a positive moment of truth.

Tourists who stay at a resort are likely to spend money elsewhere, and newly employed resort workers might also be encouraged to spend more at local shops. Property taxes would not necessarily increase because the taxes collected from the tourists themselves could lead to reduced local taxes. The quantity of goods is more likely to increase than decrease because the increased customers will lead to more demand for products.

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The willingness to step out of their comfort zones to take positive risks. Self-confidence is a positive belief in your own talents, skills, and objectives. Self-confident people are willing to take positive risks, which involve stepping out of their comfort zones. Self-confident people understand that mistakes are a part of life and do not let the risk of failure keep them from taking action. Self-confident people are willing to admit their mistakes, accept compliments while remaining humble, and maintain their beliefs and behaviors even when others are critical of those beliefs and behaviors."

      "explanation": "Organizational culture. Organizational culture is the standards, rituals, attitudes, and belief systems that create the workplace environment and influence the interactions within it. Organizational culture is the \u201ctone\u201d of the work environment. Because each business functions differently, each business has a unique culture. For example, one business environment might have a rigid chain of command, a strict dress code, an inflexible work schedule, and provide minimal information to employees. In such an environment, employees may feel creatively suppressed and suspicious of management, which often negatively affects employees' attitudes and productivity levels. On the other hand, a business that communicates well with employees, has flexible work schedules, and encourages suggestions and creativity tends to foster trust, which creates a positive work environment. The company's legal business structure (e.g., partnership, corporation) affects the company's tax obligation. Natural resources are items found in nature that the business uses to produce goods and services. Cognitive ability is the ability to learn and understand. Individuals, rather than companies, have various cognitive abilities."

      "explanation": "Unclear or inadequate communication. One of the most important ways to model ethical behavior is to have clear, open discussions. Ethics aren't always black and white, and sometimes it can be challenging to know what to do or what is expected. Carter may have tried to model ethical behavior in regard to use of company supplies, but his employees were unaware of his expectations and did not know that their actions were unethical. This is likely due to unclear/inadequate communication. Carter did provide feedback to his employees. There is no indication that there were too many rules or that there was inconsistency in ethical principles."

        "It provides managers with the ability to accurately forecast unexpected expenses."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It encourages managers to assess activities and adjust figures more frequently. A rolling (continuous) budget replaces each passing month with a new month added to the end of the budget, so there is always a year-long budget in place. Because a new month is added to the budget on a regular basis, managers need to assess and adjust figures on a monthly basis to reflect the various factors that influence business activities. By being able to change and adapt, the rolling budget provides the business with flexibility. The zero-based budgeting method requires managers to demonstrate the need for every expense. Although unexpected expenses do come up and should be a consideration when establishing any type of budget, a rolling budget does not provide managers with an advantage over other budgeting methods in terms of forecasting unexpected expenses. A rolling budget does not eliminate the need for a master budget. A master budget can be developed using the rolling budget methodology."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Free cash flow. Free cash flow is an indication of how efficient a company is at generating cash. Although not always the case, high free cash flow can signal that the company is growing, while a negative free cash flow can be a sign that the company is suffering financially. Free cash flow is determined by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. To determine a business's working capital, subtract current liabilities from current assets. Amortization is used by accountants to lower the value of a loan over time. Profit is the reward a business receives for taking the risk involved in investing in a business, or the income that is left once all expenses are paid."

An advantage of using a spreadsheet program is that a business can make various assumptions about sales and find out quickly what effect they will have on its financial situation. For example, a business could change the level of sales by different percentages, such as 5% or 10%, to find out the effect that would have on net income. The spreadsheet program automatically does the calculations. Although keeping appointments might lead to sales, a salesperson would likely not use a spreadsheet program to track appointments.

These differences in guests' preferences make it very difficult for hotels to determine which type of service guests actually prefer in any given situation.

For example, if a customer purchases several soft drinks from room service, the hotel can store that information in a database and then prepare the room by stocking the mini fridge with the same soft drink upon the customer's return. While restaurants can use social media to receive feedback, they are not necessarily using a database to improve customer satisfaction when they do so. A variety of services can be integrated into one system, but this does not necessarily depend on a database; rather, it is due to hotel and restaurant management system software.

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Automated. Room key cards are similar to credit cards. When the guest swipes their room key card at the point of sale (e.g., hotel restaurant), the computer chip that is embedded in the room key card transmits transaction data to the hotel's computer system, which adds the expense to the guest's folio or bill. The guest pays for their purchases during the checkout process. This software helps the resort accurately track its guests' buying behavior and increases hotel efficiency because it reduces paperwork by using a central bookkeeping system. The software is not independent, remote, or retractable."

Businesses use the information they obtain from data mining to make different types of business decisions. For example, a business might want to increase its sales. The business might use data-mining techniques to determine and analyze which customers possess the highest buying potential. The primary purpose of data mining is not to stabilize sales, develop services, or summarize ideas."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Salesperson A. Businesses often maintain databases of information to determine which salesperson has the highest amount of sales during a period of time. The database helps the business analyze information because salespeople with the most orders or the highest average invoice are not necessarily the ones who have the highest amount of sales. In this situation, salesperson A has 125 orders that each average $215 for a total of $26,875 ($215 x 125 = $26,875). Although salesperson B and salesperson D each have more orders, the average invoice is less, which results in less sales ($26,832 for salesperson B and $26,797 for salesperson D). Salesperson C has a higher average invoice amount but fewer orders for a total of $26,378."

      "explanation": "Descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data. Examples of descriptive statistics are mean (the simple mathematical average of a set of numbers), median (the middle number in a sorted list of numbers), and mode (the number occurring most frequently in a set). By analyzing descriptive statistics, marketing and other business managers can see the current state of affairs within the company as well as past performance. Predictive statistics, on the other hand, are used to help forecast future probabilities and trends based on historical data. Researchers use various modeling and statistical techniques to achieve this goal. In this example, Roger is analyzing descriptive statistics, not predictive statistics to aid his decision-making. He is not coding data or studying customer feedback."

Secondary data, on the other hand, are facts and figures that have already been collected for purposes other than the project at hand.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Limit shore tours to ones approved by the cruise line. Cruise lines conduct extensive research and planning to determine the best route and destination points. The companies are familiar with many of the local tour and transportation services at the ports of call, and not all of them meet the standards of service and ethical responsibility that the cruise line or traveler expects. Therefore, tourists should use tour companies that are approved or recommended by the cruise line. This recommendation also applies to any transportation service (e.g., bus or taxi). Valuables, such as jewelry, should be locked in a safe on the ship to reduce the chance of theft onboard the ship or while on shore. For safety measures, a tourist should travel in organized groups instead of alone while on shore."

Quality assurance methods are typically proactive and often save money since defective products are never produced. Reactive quality control focuses on fixing problems after they've happened. This can include tasks such as filling out a corrective action report, inspecting finished products, and processing customer returns. Reactive quality control tends to cost more money and create more waste, since problems aren't discovered until after the products have already been produced."

      "explanation": "Monitor and control expenses. An invoice (bill) documents how much a customer or client owes for the goods or services a business provides. To operate, a business orders office supplies, outsources services (e.g., legal advice), leases equipment, etc. Its vendors send the business bills (invoices) that state how much the business owes. The business monitors and tracks the invoices to make sure it is billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect tax amount) on a bill, the business will likely contact the vendor to make necessary adjustments. Tracking invoices is one way the business controls its expenses. Accounts receivable are the monies coming into the business. Businesses do not track invoices to evaluate the vendors' performance levels."

      "explanation": "Low profit margin. Pricing affects promotion decisions in a number of different ways. For instance, products with very low profit margins are usually promoted in lower-priced media. In other words, companies that have low profit margins and/or small promotional budgets often promote themselves largely on social media, which usually costs very little. The opposite would be true for a product with a high profit margin. Products that have high profit margins are usually promoted in a combination of media, including radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines. Flexible and realistic prices are not as likely to affect a business's promotional decisions."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "No, it can delay entry into the full market. Test marketing involves introducing a product to a limited market to see what its acceptance will be. Test marketing serves to guide the planning of actual marketing strategies. The product may be tried out in specific locations to get customers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 reactions before starting a wider distribution. However, not all new products need test marketing. Test marketing may not be used for some products/services because it is costly, delays entry into the full market, provides no guarantee of actual success, may not give an accurate picture of performance, and gives competitors an opportunity to steal the idea while it is being tested."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Product cannibalization. Businesses watch and adjust their product lines to meet customers' changing needs and wants, which helps them compete effectively in the marketplace and generate profits. A business might decide to remove a product from its product mix to avoid or eliminate cannibalization, which occurs when the sale of one of a company's products takes away sales from another product. In short, the business will give up one product to extend the life cycle of another product. Alteration is a product-mix strategy that involves making changes to the company's products or lines. Alteration may involve completely redesigning a product or changing things such as color, style, or packaging. Substitution involves using a similar product in place of another good or service. A business might substitute one or a few products, but it is unlikely to substitute items for its entire inventory. Inventory shrinkage involves inventory losses due to shoplifting, employee theft, breakage, misplaced goods, or poor record keeping."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "New products are easier to introduce. Products are easier to introduce under an accepted, recognized brand name. One of the reasons this is true is that family brands are tied to company image. Family brands are used for related products, not unrelated products. The amount of shelf space needed depends on the number of items in the product line. Sellers are generally more willing to provide additional shelf space for an addition to a successful family brand."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Are cheaper and safer than introducing new products. A product extension, or line extension, uses an existing brand to introduce a new and related product in the same product category, often to satisfy previously unmet needs in that market. Because product extensions can rely on the reputation of the parent brand, they are often less expensive and less risky than introducing a completely new product. Brand extensions allow businesses to compete in different product categories. Product extensions have no bearing on manufacturing speed. Product extensions build off of, but do not replace, products already on the market."

An effective corporate brand uses a variety of tools that creates and reinforces certain impressions and images of the business in the minds of the consumers, which involves communicating the company's benefits. For example, an entertainment business's brand is likely to communicate the idea or image of \"fun\" as a benefit to consumers. Successful brands do not communicate motives in a vague way. Not all members of the target market may understand the business's jargon. Procedures are the processes that employees use to perform certain tasks."

When selecting vendors and suppliers, companies should make sure that the vendor they choose will be able to fulfill the company's needs in a timely manner so that delays and other production issues can be avoided. It is unnecessary for a vendor to agree with the company's stance on political issues, and politics should not be a reason for choosing one vendor over another. It would be inappropriate and unethical to select a vendor simply because the vendor was willing to cooperate in unethical business practices. A vendor's ability to participate in the company's annual volunteer event should not affect a vendor's quality as a potential business partner."

The first thing Brandon should do before making any sales is to learn about the cars he will be selling, so that he can effectively help his customers find cars that fit their specific needs. Establishing relationships with fellow salespeople is beneficial, but not necessary to make sales.

If all other factors were equal, the information about no finance charges might be the factor that caused a customer to buy from the salesperson's company rather than another.

Unfortunately, that will only get you so far\u2014over time, price and quality can be easily matched among competitors. In selling, customer service is where the real competition among businesses begins. For example, imagine you're a salesperson for a company that manufactures tires to sell to automakers. The tires you make aren't much different than the tires your clients could get from any other company, and the prices are similar, too. That's when customer service becomes key. Are you available when your clients need you? Are you willing to help them when they need to change orders? Can you help your customers if there's a problem with their shipments? These are the actions that will separate your company from the rest of the pack. Promotions, online reviews, and product longevity may help your product sell, but customer service is where the competition among businesses truly begins."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "$85.06. Many restaurants offer special prices on certain types of dinners to attract customers. Customers order those dinners because they are priced lower than usual. If customers also have coupons for discounts, the restaurant calculates the discount to determine the total cost. In this example, the restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 X 2 = $45.98; $45.98 X 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90). Then, subtract the discount from the cost of the two dinners ($45.98 - $6.90 = $39.08). Add the discounted price of the two dinners to the regular price of the other two dinners to calculate the total cost for the table ($39.08 + $22.99 + $22.99 = $85.06)."

There's no indication that Lin is trying to persuade or entertain the audience. Since Lin prepared her presentation in advance, it is not likely to be an impromptu one, given on the spur of the moment without advanced preparation."

They usually don't like to waste time, so Sarah should get to the point of her communication quickly, especially since the customer is in a hurry. The customer is not likely to want to take time to talk about themselves, discuss detailed statistics and information, or develop a relationship with Sarah."

Executive summaries are often included in long, complex reports that contain a lot of information. By reading the executive summary, the reader can determine which section of a long report that they want to read in more detail. A six-page case study, an employee handbook, and a manuscript outline do not require an executive summary."

Suspicious clients will often be your customer for life if you can gain their confidence and trust."

      "explanation": "Seamless. An organization's structure should ensure that customers' experiences with the business are seamless. This can sometimes be difficult because different departments may have different methods of reaching business goals. Departments must work together to keep CRM a priority. Businesses want customer experiences to result in profit, but organizational structure does not necessarily ensure this. Businesses do not want customers' experiences to be endless or time-consuming."

Peak seasons see the highest volume of customer demand, so managers often hire temporary staff during those seasons to make sure year-round staff isn't overwhelmed. Touchpoints include interactions between businesses and customers or potential customers. A critical moment occurs when customer experience is more significant than at other times. Residence time is the amount of time a customer will spend in a restaurant from start to finish."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "To empower staff members to resolve customer service complaints. When hotels train their staff members on using guest recovery solutions, it gives them the confidence and the tools to resolve customer complaints effectively. The purpose of guest recovery is to resolve any dissatisfaction so that guests come back for another visit. Guest recovery solutions are actions taken to satisfy guests' needs and requests to increase customer loyalty. When customers are unhappy, explaining hotel policies is not likely to appease them. The use of guest recovery solutions is not typically related to a hotel's legal obligations and does not reduce them. A hotel's legal obligations relate to protecting a guest's privacy and safety and to fulfilling the contractual obligations of a guest's reservations."

        "Tell the customer that the steak was properly prepared",

        "Listen to the diner's concerns to determine a resolution"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Listen to the diner's concerns to determine a resolution. It's crucial for a waiter to respectfully listen to an unsatisfied diner to show concern and to determine the true cause of dissatisfaction. Explaining that a steak was properly prepared when the customer feels differently shows a lack of respect and concern. Instead of offering one solution, the staff member should work with the customer to determine what solution they would prefer. For example, if the diner doesn't have time to wait for a new meal, offering one is a poor solution. It is also important for a staff member to follow up with the customer to make sure they are satisfied with their experience before leaving the restaurant. If a staff member fails to handle and resolve customer complaints in a satisfactory manner, the customer is likely to never return."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Business success or failure depends on customer service. In the hospitality and tourism industry, success or failure depends on the level and quality of customer service. Customer satisfaction is heavily influenced by service, and the greater the customer satisfaction, the higher the revenues for the business. Customer service has a greater impact than price when it comes to a customer's buying decision in this industry. Also, customer service can be taught through employee training programs; in fact, training is a crucial tool when it comes to ensuring high-quality customer service."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Get to know customers. Companies should be familiar with their customers and information about them, such as their previous purchases and other issues they've had with the company. This will help customer service employees prevent problems before they occur and give customers what they need. Focusing on selling products will not help companies anticipate customer needs. Planning customer service efforts is a good idea, but it is not necessarily related to anticipating customer needs without asking. Offering online chat support will not necessarily help companies anticipate customer needs without asking."

A moment of truth is any time a customer engages with a company and has an opportunity to form an impression. Moments of truth can be small. By placing chocolates on the guest's pillow, the company has created a positive customer experience that might give the customer a lasting, positive impression. While the business, manufacturer, and sales representative examples are all positive, they do not relate to the customer experience and, therefore, are not examples of a moment of truth."

In this case, John decided to spend his money on a trip to an amusement park rather than on a new pair of jeans. Since the pair of jeans was given up, it is the opportunity cost.

Time utility involves making products available at the time they are wanted or needed by consumers. Place utility occurs when goods and services are available at the place (location) they are wanted or needed by consumers.

The law of supply and demand is an economic principle which states that the supply of a good or service will increase when demand is great and decrease when demand is low. Producers and consumers generally control supply and demand. Market price is the price that exists in the marketplace at any particular moment.

Allowing employees to set their own pace is one way of enriching jobs. Job enlargement is combining job tasks so that a worker has more responsibility for the completion of a job. Job rotation involves moving people around to different jobs to teach them new skills and to show them how tasks are interrelated.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Wide. Many factors affect how many employees a manager can effectively supervise, which is the manager's span of control. Employees who have highly specialized skills, such as research scientists, can usually perform their work without a lot of supervision. If employees require less supervision, the manager can usually handle more employees at once, which means the manager has a wide span of control. When employees need a lot of guidance and supervision to perform their work, it takes more of the manager's time. In these situations, the manager tends to have a narrow span of control. Intensive and extensive are not types of spans of control."

        "lower occupancy rates.",
        "higher property taxes."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Lower occupancy rates. During an economic recession, consumers and businesses spend less money. When spending decreases, fewer people travel for leisure or business purposes, which results in unsold hotel rooms. When hotel rooms are not sold, the facilities' occupancy rates decrease. When occupancy rates decrease, hotels tend to lay off employees to lower their labor costs, which results in an increase in the unemployment rate in the community. To reduce the risk of business closure and further economic turmoil, governments do not usually increase property taxes during a recession."

An irresponsible employee might leave as planned, expect others to stay late, or say there is an emergency."

Stereotypes often influence the way people think about other people and might prevent businesspeople from developing cultural sensitivity. To be culturally sensitive, businesspeople need to be aware that people in other parts of the world live and think very differently than they do. Businesspeople need to be open-minded rather than assume that all people in one culture behave in a certain manner. Demographics are the physical and social characteristics of the population. Ethics are the basic principles that govern your behavior.

Subtract the total operating expenses from the gross profit to get the net income or net loss for the coffee shop ($26,000 - $27,000 = - $1,000). A net loss occurs when total expenses are greater than total revenue. Net income occurs when total revenue is greater than total expenses."

A master budget is made up of information from specialized budgets that are generated by individual departments. Each specialized budget reflects the goals and activities for that particular area of the company. It's likely that the previous year's budget is taken into consideration, but not simply by adding 10% to its amounts. Internal sales forecasts are part of the sales budget, not a direct component of the master budget. Level of competition is not a direct factor in the master budget.

The price-to-cash flow ratio of a company can be compared with its competitors to see whether the company's stock is overpriced or underpriced. To calculate the Sun Valley Corporation's price-to-cash flow ratio, first calculate the cash flow per share by dividing total cash flow by the number of shares ($15 million / $1 million = $15 per share). Then, divide the stock price by the cash flow per share to calculate the corporation's price-to-cash flow ratio ($25 / $15 = 1.67)."

Anyone with a computer and access to the internet can go online to obtain information about airline flights, cruises, hotel accommodations, etc., and buy those products online from the supplier. For example, a customer can access the home page of American Airlines, select a flight, book the flight, pay for the flight, and download a boarding pass. This eliminates the middleman, or the travel agent, and allows customers to buy directly from suppliers. Deregulation, commercialization, and information do not enable customers to bypass travel agents."

Hospitality and tourism companies can use big data to analyze how customers interact with their brands and use their services, helping the companies better understand what makes customers happy. For example, a hotel company could analyze customer data to determine if a certain individual is likely to take advantage of spa services or not.

For example, if the mean is highest between 6-9 a.m., they can decide to have two extra employees come in during that 3-hour window.

Many hotel chains, airlines, and other hospitality and tourism businesses use customer loyalty programs to collect pertinent customer information such as guests' contact information, purchasing behavior, and preferences. In exchange for this information, businesses with loyalty programs offer special deals, discounts, and benefits to guests who participate. Hospitality and tourism customers typically don't have to share their employment history or monthly income to take part in a loyalty program. If they apply for a credit card offered by a hospitality and tourism business, they often are required to provide that information. A feasibility study, which typically has no connection to customer loyalty programs, is an organized inquiry into the possible success of a business idea or venture. Distribution channels are paths or routes that goods or services take from the producer to the ultimate consumer or industrial user. While customers taking part in a loyalty program may be asked to identify their preferred communication channels, they aren't typically asked about their preferred distribution channels. from https://www.openkey.co/2018/02/08/how-to-capture-more-hotel-guest-data"

One of the main roles of a project manager is to lead the group to achieve the project's goal. Members follow an effective leader because the leader motivates them and includes them in making decisions. Education is not a skill. Integrity is a personal quality rather than a skill. Strength is a physical attribute."

That is what occurs when an employee pads their expense account. Having authorization to change the amount specified on a check is not pilferage. Installing personally owned software on your computer may violate company policies; however, it does not represent employee pilferage. Hacking into a competitor's computer network to obtain trade secrets is a computer crime, rather than pilferage."

For example, a hotel might provide its guests and employees with an access code to get into the main lobby from outdoors at nighttime. Hotels do not provide vendors with electronic key cards. It would be very expensive to change traditional locks every week. A hotel enacts a lockout by preventing a guest from entering their room when the guest does not pay the bill, exhibits unsafe behavior, etc."

If businesses develop a reputation of providing low quality goods and services, they may lose customers, which is costly. Therefore, it is to the business's advantage to use quality control methods so the work will be done correctly rather than spend money to correct mistakes, handle customer complaints, and find new customers. Using quality control methods involves time, but it is time well spent to reduce the cost of correcting mistakes. Using quality control methods usually decreases waste.

If the business only collects the data that is necessary, rather than keeping a large amount of extraneous personal information, it will be less vulnerable. Sharing data with all employees increases the risk that customer data will be compromised. Storing data indefinitely also increases the risk of a data breach.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available. A decrease in the number of guests occurs during economic slowdowns because people are reluctant to spend their discretionary income on travel. Consequently, there is an increase in the number of rooms available as more rooms become available for rent. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available does not follow the law of supply and demand, which suggests that as demand for rooms go up, supply typically goes down. A decrease in the number of guests and a decrease in the number of rooms available would work the other way because as demand goes down, the supply of rooms available for rent typically goes up. An increase in the number of guests and a decrease in the number of rooms available typically occurs during good economic times when people are more willing to spend their discretionary income on travel."

Before developing product extensions, it is important to consider the wants and needs of the target market. If the target market is not interested in the product extension, there is no reason to develop it. For example, a discount airline that provides inexpensive flights to regional airports probably would not sell expensive, full-course meals to passengers. The meals would be a product extension of the main travel product, which is air transportation. However, the target market, which is travelers who want economical air transportation, would not want or need the expensive meals. The cost of advertising new ideas, attitudes of industry employees, and complexity of the purchasing process are not considerations when developing product extensions in the travel and tourism industry."

In 1967, the ship moved to Long Beach, California, and now serves as a stationary \"floating\" hotel and event venue that reflects the decor of days gone by. Based on the information provided, what is the Queen Mary's competitive advantage?",
      "options": [
        "Its customer service efforts",
        "Its tropical excursion options",
        "Its unique historical attributes",
        "Its gaming and entertainment attractions"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Its unique historical attributes. Long Beach marketers communicate the ship's rich history to attract lodging guests and visitors. The ship is stationary, so it does not offer tropical excursions. There is not enough information to determine if the Queen Mary offers gaming and entertainment attractions or the level of customer service the ship provides."

      "explanation": "Playing follow the leader. Competing businesses within the same industry usually use quite similar promotional mixes because many of the factors affecting the promotional mix are the same for those businesses. Businesses also use the same promotional activities to prevent losing customers to competitors. Changing the distribution channel would not necessarily make the business more competitive. Reducing the promotional budget or trying not to outdo the competition would make the business less competitive."

      "explanation": "Sweepstakes. A sweepstake is a promotional method that involves a chance of winning a prize. Entering a sweepstake usually involves filling out a form and sending it to the cruise line. This is an effective way for a cruise line to promote a new cruise because many potential customers will read about the sweepstake and be encouraged to enter. Even if they do not win, they might be interested enough to book the cruise. In addition, the cruise line will obtain the names and addresses of a large group of people who enter the sweepstake. The cruise line can then send these people more promotional information in the future. Coupons, premiums, and rebates are promotional methods, but they are not methods that a cruise line would use to generate widespread interest in a new cruise."

Often, hotels will also send an email to guests that contains their confirmation numbers.

Gift cards are similar to credit or debit cards in that they have magnetic strips that transmit information during the payment process. Cashiers must activate the card at the time the gift giver buys the gift card so the recipient can use it. Most businesses allow customers to pay for gift cards by various methods including check, credit/debit cards, and cash. For customer relationship management purposes, cashiers may ask customers for their telephone numbers; however, this action is not required to complete the sales transaction. If the customer pays for the gift card with a credit or debit card, they are required to sign the sales receipt."

Many of these laws have an impact on the way businesses operate by requiring them to decrease pollution or control waste. As a result, businesses often need to spend money to comply with the rules and regulations, which leads to an increase in operating costs. For example, a business might need to purchase pollution-control devices. Environmental laws do not require businesses to hire more employees or develop exterior landscapes. The laws do not limit equipment purchases. In fact, businesses may need to buy more equipment to comply with the laws."

When a channel leader places unreasonable pressure on a channel member to do something that is not in the best interest of the channel member, it is using coercion. For example, a channel leader that yields a lot of power in the distribution chain may set unrealistic sales goals for a dealer, or it may pressure a supplier to lower its prices to a point that it hurts the supplier's profits. Coercion tends to create channel conflict, leads to unfair and unsatisfactory business relationships, and often disrupts the distribution process.

      "explanation": "Authority to demand cooperation. Strong leaders have the authority and power to influence others and direct the actions of others. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid conflict within the channel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for the leader to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to accomplish their individual tasks. When each member is cooperating and working for the good of the channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not necessary for the leader to develop friendships. Channel leaders usually do not provide training. It is not possible to regulate change, although an effective leader will help channel members adjust to change."

Affinity marketing is a strategy in which an organization solicits responses from a group that shares a common interest or activity. If a credit card has a sports team's logo on it, fans of that team might be more likely to choose that particular company. An airline that offers frequent flyer miles is not an affinity partnership because there is no relationship between the airline and another organization; rather, this is an example of frequency marketing. A restaurant giving discounts to members of its rewards program is also an example of a frequency marketing strategy.

Possession utility can be created through promotions which increase consumer demand for goods. Businesses also help create possession utility by offering a number of purchasing arrangements that make it easy for customers to buy. Financial is not a type of utility.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The government pays workers based on quantity rather than quality. In a communist command economy, most resources are allocated toward industrial goods rather than consumer goods. The few consumer goods that are available are often poor quality because the government pays workers based on the quantity, not the quality, of what they produce. People in communist command economies need consumer goods as much as those in other economic systems do. High taxes do not necessarily have a direct effect on production of consumer goods. Finally, people in a communist command economy do not consume everything that they produce; this is instead a characteristic of a traditional economy."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Use a price deflator. Inflation can distort GDP by making it higher, not because production has increased, but because prices are higher. A price deflator is an economic metric that converts prices to a base dollar value and allows GDP to be accurately compared over time. Double counting occurs when production is counted more than once. It is not related to inflation. The balance of trade is the difference between imports and exports. It does not relate to the effects of inflation on GDP. Nominal GDP is GDP that has not been adjusted to account for the effects of inflation. GDP that has been adjusted to account for inflation is called real GDP."

      "explanation": "Recession. A recession is a six-month's contraction in the gross domestic product (GDP). A recession usually results in rising unemployment and people having less money to spend on consumer goods. Excess demand exists when consumers want more goods than are available to buy. Inflation is a rise in prices that may occur when demand exceeds supply. A trade deficit results from more imports than exports."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Law of diminishing returns. The law of diminishing returns is an economic concept that states that if one input increases while others are constant, at some point the increases in output will decline. In this example, Kelly added six new employees to her business without changing anything else. Kelly's business reached the point at which output could no longer increase unless the inputs also increased. This example demonstrates the law of diminishing returns, not the need for effective employee training, the harm of taking business risks, or the danger of hiring employees."

        "Economic recession",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Tight money supply. Many factors affect interest rates, including business cycles, consumer spending, inflation, and the money supply. If the money supply is low or tight, there is less money available to lend. This causes interest rates to increase. The government might implement policies to tighten the money supply when the rate of inflation rapidly increases. When investment spending increases, the money supply is usually loose, so interest rates are lower\u2014it is cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow money. During a recession, businesses are not expanding, unemployment increases, and consumer spending decreases. Because a recession negatively affects the economy, the government may implement policies that lower interest rates to stimulate commercial growth and consumer spending."

If you know what you are doing wrong, you can change that behavior in the future. Feedback does not necessarily reinforce your own opinions, as others may have a different view of you than you have of yourself. Feedback should address your strengths and weaknesses, not those of others. You should not allow negative feedback to make you defensive.

Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from high to low. Feeling that you could do a job you have read about would indicate your level of self-esteem is high.

      "explanation": "Predict and control risks. Marketing information is all of the marketing-related data available from inside and outside the business. It includes information about past situations and what is happening now. By obtaining and using marketing information, business managers can predict the risks that might occur in the future and take steps to control those risks. For example, if current marketing information indicates that one product is losing popularity, a business can modify the product or repackage it to be more appealing. As a result, the business might avoid losing customers, which is a future risk. Managers often use marketing information to prepare documents and reports, but that is not an advantage of obtaining and using the information. Business managers do not obtain and use marketing information to train and direct employees, or to review and understand regulations."

      "explanation": "Listen to the customers to understand their concerns. The first thing an employee should do is to listen to the customer to try to determine the reason for the complaint. If employees fully understand their customers' complaints, they will be better able to solve the problem. Employees should express empathy, but they should not take customers' complaints as personal attacks against them. It is not always possible to give customers whatever they want to make them happy. In some situations, the business and the customer may need to compromise. Stating the business's policies before listening to the customers' complaints may frustrate the customers and make them angry."

SUGGING is an acronym for \"selling under the guise of research.\" SUGGING is an unethical practice in which a marketer pretends to conduct research but, in fact, is really attempting to sell a good or service to a consumer. SUGGING is deceptive and rarely facilitates a long-term selling relationship. It also harms the integrity of the general marketing-research field because potential respondents who have been subjected to SUGGING are less likely to trust researchers and are likely to question their true motives. A telemarketer who asks a person if they know anyone who might buy a certain product is trying to obtain a referral. Sending samples to consumers is a promotional technique. A salesperson providing a customer the opportunity to try a product for a certain period of time is implementing a strategy to make a sale."

Follow-up letters also remind the interviewer of the specific applicant and help create a favorable impression. If there are several applicants with comparable qualifications, an interviewer might select the one who remembered to send a follow-up letter. An applicant's resume, references, and test scores usually are submitted with the employment application or during the employment interview."

The market price is controlled by supply and demand. In an oligopoly, competition is more likely to be based on style or brand than on price. In a monopoly, there is virtually no competition because there is only one seller or provider of a good or service.

Businesses that agree to coordinate the discounts and credit terms that they offer their customers are guilty of fixing the price of those services. If all the competing businesses in one area agree to offer the same discounts and credit terms, the customers have no choice in selecting a business that offers a different price.

Producers and sellers are protected by well-written warranties and guarantees because their responsibilities to the customer are clearly defined. Informing customers about how problems will be handled helps prevent purchasers from making unreasonable claims against producers or sellers. Decreasing consumer confidence is not a purpose of warranties and guarantees, but increasing it is. Decreasing feedback from customers and avoiding a customer-oriented focus are not purposes of warranties and guarantees; in fact, increasing them is a benefit a company receives from offering warranties and guarantees with its products."

By delivering promotional messages in multiple ways, a business is more likely to reach its target market than it would be using one form of promotion alone. No one promotional mix element is the best. Many factors affect the selection of a promotional mix. Marketers know that a promotional mix that is appropriate for one business may be totally inappropriate for another.

Manufacturers, sales training courses, sales manuals, bulletins, sales meetings, promotional materials, the product itself, company contacts, and publications are also sources of product information. Firsthand product information is not likely to be found at the library or the factory. Competitors do not usually share information with one another."

      "explanation": "Keeping in touch. Good salespeople recognize that keeping in contact with customers is one of the best ways to maintain their partnerships. Sometimes this involves sending out a thank-you note, as in Joaquin's case. Sometimes this can be as simple as a follow-up phone call, or for major clients, it may even involve a personal visit. Soliciting feedback, being prompt, and having a good attitude are all important keys to customer service, but Joaquin is not demonstrating them in this example."

Spreadsheets can be used in sales to track and evaluate sales volume and sales dollars. Word-processing software is primarily used to create text documents, such as contracts, memos, and letters. Presentation software is generally used by salespeople when making a sales or product presentation to customers. Graphic and design software is often used to create catalogs, brochures, and other professional illustrations."

      "explanation": "The fact that the client needs the product. After locating potential clients, salespeople must learn about prospects\u2019 business needs and problems to determine how their products can meet those needs or solve those problems. Follow-up techniques are used after sales presentations. Clearly written users\u2019 manuals should identify business policies and services. A sales presentation does not depend on the location of new clients, but rather on satisfaction of customer needs."

Selling-activity policies focus on providing salespeople with guidelines for interacting with customers or potential customers. They are basic directions that explain how salespeople should approach and deal with customers and how to best use their time. An installation policy would be considered a type of service policy.

      "explanation": "Negligence. Negligence is conduct that drops below a reasonable standard of care and causes harm to another person or persons. When a pharmaceutical company accidentally includes a poisonous substance in a drug, it is an example of negligence, not invasion of privacy, defamation, or strict liability. The company did not invade its consumers' privacy or harm its users' reputations (defamation). The company would not likely be held in strict liability, because strict liability implies that the tortfeasor (the company) was engaged in an inherently dangerous activity. Making and selling over-the-counter drugs is not generally an inherently dangerous activity to the public."

Environmental regulations set pollution standards that businesses must meet, establish rules for disposing of waste, encourage recycling, and monitor illegal dumping. The goal is to protect the environment. By encouraging businesses to participate in recycling programs, environmental regulations help to conserve natural resources and control waste. Agencies that oversee environmental regulations are the ones that enforce the laws.

      "explanation": "Exclusive dealing. Exclusive dealing is illegal when it hinders a competitive environment. In the example, the manufacturer holds a big part of the market and is attempting to keep its dealers from selling competing products. This keeps other businesses from entering or competing in the marketplace, which is unfair, particularly to small businesses. Tying agreements are illegal agreements that require a customer to buy other products to obtain the desired goods and services. Selective distribution is a business strategy in which a producer sells products through several, but not all, wholesalers and/or retailers. Channel control refers to the level of authority that each member has in the distribution channel."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The gray market. Gray-market goods are foreign-made products that are imported into countries by suppliers that are not authorized by the manufacturers. Sometimes, manufacturers issue licenses to the foreign businesses to produce the items, but do not give them permission to distribute them in the country of origin. In some countries, laws do not specifically prohibit the distribution of these types of foreign-made items. The manufacturers' authorized dealers feel this is unfair (and socially irresponsible) because they lose sales when consumers pay lower prices for the foreign-made items. This practice often creates unfair competition. A strategic alliance is a partnership between two businesses that is mutually beneficial."

When a business shares its sales forecast with its vendors, they have time to plan and make sure that they have the products available when and where the products are needed. An annual report, a cash flow analysis, and a media schedule do not provide the information that vendors need to plan their inventory and delivery strategies."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Vertical channel conflict. Vertical conflict may occur among members who are on different levels of the same channel of distribution. For example, a manufacturer traditionally sells products to wholesalers who sell the products to a business. If the manufacturer starts to sell directly to the business, the wholesalers are eliminated from the channel of distribution, which might create conflict because the wholesalers are losing customers and revenue. Reverse distribution involves recycling an existing product. Horizontal conflict may occur among members who are on the same level in a channel of distribution. Exclusive distribution involves selling to only one distributor."

This kind of complaint is the type of information that should be shared with all staff right away since it could affect the entire company. In addition, all staff should be reminded of company policy in such areas. Information about employees' problems is likely to be passed through the grapevine, but it should not be announced to staff.

In many cases, the purpose of an informational message is to help the recipient make a decision. For this to happen, the business employee should explain the situation and include sufficient data. If recipients clearly understand the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the situation, they usually have sufficient information to make a decision. Clear and concise writing enables a recipient to read the message. The letterhead usually includes the business's name, address, and phone number so recipients are able to contact the business.

      "explanation": "The data are too complex to describe in the body of the text. Tables present text or numbers in a grid format. The table allows readers to see groups of data together for comparison. Tables are also useful because they summarize data in an easy to read format. Tables present data (e.g., statistics) that may be too wordy or complex to describe in a paragraph format. Tables should appear in a document where they are most appropriate, which may be the body, conclusions, recommendations, or appendices.

This often causes the competitors to go out of business, which can lead to a monopoly. A monopoly is a condition in which one supplier controls the market, and there are no substitute goods or services readily available. Predatory pricing is unethical and is illegal in many countries. Price lining is the practice of selling products at a limited number of predetermined price points or levels. Captive pricing is a tactic in which the business sets a low price for the primary product and sets high prices for the product's accessories.

When an employee experiences several interruptions during a short time span, their work falls behind. Falling behind on a project often triggers stress, especially if a tight deadline is looming. This is what is triggering Ann's stress. She has fallen behind and doesn't know if she will meet her deadline, because her work was interrupted. There is not enough information to determine if Ann feels that her workload is unrealistic, her employer has unclear business policies, or she has difficult relationships with her coworkers."

Certain events, like annual income, an inheritance, and money from the sale of an asset, are taxable.

      "explanation": "Pooling their money with other investors. A mutual fund is a collection of stocks and bonds. When you buy a mutual fund, you are pooling your money with other investors, allowing you to pay for a professional manager to select investments for the group. Therefore, when an individual invests in a mutual fund, they are not selecting their own investment options, nor are they solely purchasing corporate and government bonds.

An example is a business that conducts a very limited survey for the purpose of advertising that the majority of respondents prefer its product to the product of a competitor.

Some questionnaires contain built-in codes, such as when the respondent is asked to rate agreement with a question on a scale of 1 to 5. The numbers from 1 to 5 are the numeric codes. For other types of questionnaires, researchers often establish a master code. For example, there are six possible responses to a certain question and the third answer has a numeric value of 3, but that number is not printed on the questionnaire. Tabulating the responses occurs after the surveys are completed. Sorting and marking do not assign numeric values to each response on a marketing questionnaire."

In many cases, the type of service provided must be tailored to fit the needs of the customer. For example, one customer might need an order delivered overnight while another customer needs to return a defective item. Salespeople should determine what the customer needs and then provide that service. Not all services need to save money for customers, although many services do not add cost. Services need to be tailored to the customer rather than the same for all customers.

The goal is to survey enough people to obtain an accurate representation, but not more than necessary. In many cases, the population affected by the research is very large and researchers are unable to survey all of them.

In an audit, the company may have to provide certain accounting records to prove that its books are accurate and complete. While governments sometimes outsource certain tasks, government outsourcing isn't an important reason for a business to keep its records in order.

Sales volume analysis is a breakdown of sales volume data that allows a company to measure its actual sales against a number of different criteria. Product awareness refers to the target market's knowledge and understanding of a certain brand or product. Channel management refers to processes by which marketers ensure that products are distributed to customers efficiently and effectively."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Channel differentiation. The positioning strategies that businesses use depend on many factors including the type of product and the business's objectives. Businesses that use selective distribution channels choose the dealers and distributors (channel members) who will best represent the brand, be willing to learn about the product, and work hard to market the product for the business. By selecting the best suited distributors, the business is differentiating itself through its channel members. Depending on the business's objectives, the dealers or channel members will be responsible for communicating product attributes, quality, and value to the end users. Customization involves creating unique or one-of-a-kind products or activities for individuals or specific groups."

Public service promotion is a type of institutional promotion that informs consumers about non-controversial issues that are in the public's interest.

      "explanation": "Often buy impulse items more freely. Credit encourages customers to buy more freely. Credit customers like being able to buy without worrying about whether they have the cash on hand to pay for their purchases. As a result, they may buy impulse items that catch their attention. Store profit is affected by credit customers, who often spend less time making buying decisions than other customers. Credit accounts are not always paid on time, and for the retailer, collecting past-due accounts is a disadvantage of the credit system."

      "explanation": "Tasteful. When developing promotional activities (e.g., advertisements), it is important for a business to create interest and recognition for the product or company, but not offend the target market with distasteful material. An intangible item is something that cannot be detected through the senses. Promotional activities are tangible because people can see, hear, touch, and/or taste them. A vague message is unclear. Advertisers usually want to make sure that the audience understands the advertising message. Inflexible is a term that means that something is rigid or unable to adapt to a situation. The flexibility of promotional activities depends on the product and the company's goals."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Opt-in email. When a business uses opt-in email, it sends electronic promotional messages with a recipient's permission. Email is a cost-effective way to send promotional messages because the business is sending information only to individuals who want the information. Another advantage to using opt-in email is that the business does not spend money on postage, printing, telephone calls, etc. Direct mail is sent through the postal service to consumers' homes and businesses. This is one of the most expensive forms of promotion. Spam is \"junk\" email, which is an unsolicited message sent to a recipient. Recipients often discard spam without reading it. Indirect mail is direct mail that the recipient passes to another person."

      "explanation": "Industry. Governments often restrict businesses in terms of their promotional activities. Some countries have independent groups (e.g., Public Citizen) that work to influence government regulation on the behalf of the consumer. In addition, many industries (e.g., media, financial services, utilities) have self-regulatory procedures in place to protect the integrity of their field. Competitive is a general term used to describe the level of rivalry between two or more businesses to attract scarce customer dollars. Nonprofit is a legal business structure.

      "explanation": "Consumers trust each other more than brands.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A buy one, get one free deal. A pull sales promotion strategy involves a producer promoting its products directly to the consumer. Offering a buy one, get one free deal is an example of this because it targets the consumer and encourages demand for the product. Push sales promotion strategies involve a producer promoting its products to intermediaries, who then promote the products to the consumers. A booth at a trade show is a push sales promotion strategy because it allows a company to expose its products to other manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers. A sales incentive program is also an example of push strategy because it encourages salespeople to increase promotional efforts rather than target the consumer. A slotting allowance is a cash premium paid to a retailer to cover the costs of displaying a manufacturer's products on its shelves. It encourages the retailer to sell certain products, so it is a push strategy."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Customers tend to return fewer products. Discovering customer needs is the phase of the selling process in which the salesperson determines what a customer needs or wants by asking questions and listening to the customer's responses. When salespeople determine what their customers really want, they can select the most appropriate product to show them. In turn, customers are more likely to be satisfied with their purchases and less likely to return products, which is a benefit to the business. Customers often post product reviews\u2014positive and negative\u2014on the businesses' websites. When salespeople take time to discover customer needs, customers tend to be happier with their purchases and, therefore, more likely to provide favorable product reviews. A higher commission is a potential benefit to salespeople. Salespeople, rather than customers, qualify sales leads."

Selling policies are the general rules established by management to guide the personal selling effort and outline how things must be done. Selling policies are beneficial to customers because they ensure that all customers receive fair and equitable treatment. Although some businesses offer credit options, not all businesses do. If credit requirements are too rigid, then they are not beneficial to many customers. A disadvantage to salespeople of selling policies occurs when the policies are rigid and inflexible, which can restrict the salesperson's authority, which in turn can negatively affect a customer's experience with the business.

When businesses and individuals buy on credit, they pay interest on the amount of credit. If interest rates increase, businesses and individuals often stop buying on credit because it is too expensive. For example, if the interest rate is 4% and the amount of credit is $100, the cost of buying on credit is $4. However, if the interest rate increases to 15%, the cost of $100 credit is $15. Therefore, high interest rates usually cause businesses and consumers to hold off buying expensive items on credit.

      "explanation": "For the potential of a high return, you usually accept a high risk. The statement, \"For the potential of a high return, you usually accept a high risk,\" describes the relationship between risk and return. Higher risks usually bring higher returns. Lower risks usually bring lower returns. Every investment has some risk\u2014none are risk free. It would be unwise to take a high risk for something that might bring a low return. It is nearly impossible to find a high-return investment that requires only a low risk."

      "explanation": "Apply their talents where they are best used. People who use their talents are more likely to succeed in their careers. To know what their talents are, individuals must determine their personal strengths and weaknesses. For example, a very artistic person is probably going to be happier and more successful as a graphic artist than if they were to work as an accountant, which involves working with a lot of numerical data. While it is important for people to try to improve weaknesses (e.g., procrastination), this does not mean that they change their personalities. Improving relationships with friends is a personal goal rather than one that will help a person succeed in their career. Everyone experiences conflict at some time, and it cannot be eliminated."

Creating a product to solve a problem and selling that product is a good example of an entrepreneurial venture because a need has been identified and met; the product solves a problem for consumers, while the resulting sales benefit the veterinarian. A juice bar selling juice on location during special events expands its business but does not represent a new idea or problem solved. A pumpkin farm offering pumpkin carving and costume contests to create more interest is not creating something new or solving a problem.

Savings accounts are insured by the FDIC, so they're extremely safe. A certificate of deposit (CD) is a lending investment in which you lend money to a bank at a set interest rate for a particular period of time. With CDs, you are guaranteed a certain rate of return, but you can't access your money before the end of the time period without paying a penalty.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The convenience of buying now and paying later. Credit cards offer many advantages, including the convenience of buying needed items now and paying later. Other advantages of credit include the security of not needing to carry cash, fraud protection, and in some cases rewards for making purchases. Having a credit card does not mean that you have the ability to spend unlimited money. Most credit cards have credit limits that determine the maximum amount of money you are able to spend each credit period. Most credit cards also have high interest charges on unpaid credit balances. When you fail to pay off your credit card balance, your credit score is lowered\u2014making it more difficult for you to receive loans."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Fixed-rate. A fixed-rate mortgage offers the benefit of guaranteeing that the interest rate and monthly payment for the mortgage loan will stay the same for the full term of the loan. The interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage is subject to change at certain intervals based on changes in the interest rate market. Therefore, an adjustable-rate mortgage does not have a guaranteed interest rate and the monthly payment for this kind of mortgage loan will shift and change over time. Both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are often available in 15- or 30-year terms, so the span of the loan will not necessarily determine whether the interest rate or monthly payment will stay the same."

Participating in these activities may help Ryan determine if he would like to pursue a career in teaching.

In some situations, money is invested or placed in an account that generates more value. Money also serves as a medium of exchange. This occurs when money is used to obtain goods and services. Bartering involves trading one good or service for another good or service. Money also functions as a measure of value.

The main difference between a salaried employee and an hourly employee is that a salaried person is paid a fixed amount of money per pay period, whereas a wage earner is paid by the hour. In this example, Joel is a salaried employee because he gets paid the same amount each month regardless of how many hours he works. Anna, on the other hand, is a wage earner because she is paid by the hour. Earning interest is a different way to make money that involves investing your money over time. Earning dividends requires buying shares in a company. A dividend is a sum of money paid regularly by a company to its shareholders out of its profits."

A basic illustration of the time value of money is money and the interest it earns in a savings account. Principal is the deposited amount, which is not modified. Opportunity cost is what you have to give up when you make a choice. In this case, the opportunity cost of depositing $100 is spending it on something else.

      "explanation": "Immediate gratification. Opportunity cost is the benefit that is lost when a person decides to use scarce resources for one purpose rather than another. When a person places $500 in the bank, the opportunity (benefit) is having money available for the future. The cost of placing money in the bank means that the person does not have the money to purchase a desired item. When a person purchases something that they don't need but really want, the benefit to the person is immediate gratification or a sense of instant satisfaction that they have acquired the desired product. The opportunity cost (benefit lost) is not a higher discretionary income, lower salary or wages, or long-term dissatisfaction."

If you want to save $3,000 for a new truck, this is a measurable goal because you can track the amount of money you save and determine whether or not you're successful. Spending less money on clothing isn't a measurable goal because it's too vague\u2014\"less\" is more difficult to measure than a specific dollar amount. \"I'd like to pay off some of my credit card debt soon\" is also not a measurable goal\u2014there is no specific money or time element. \"I'm thinking of buying a house\" isn't a measurable goal because it isn't specific enough\u2014  houses can cost different amounts of money, so it's hard to measure unless you have a certain dollar amount in mind."

Avoiding risks in your career will not necessarily offset the effects of unexpected setbacks. Refinancing your mortgage might be necessary if you run into setbacks, but it is not a way to prepare for them.

Building a good credit history involves using credit responsibly, which includes making credit card payments on time. It is important to build good credit because lending institutions look at a person's credit history to determine if they should receive a loan. When an individual has a poor credit history, they may not be able to obtain large loans to buy a car or house or to start a new business. Responsible credit involves striving to maintain a high credit rating, looking for the lowest interest rates possible, and limiting the number of credit cards they use. Although it is a good idea to seek counseling to reduce unmanageable debt, this action is taken when a person has not used credit responsibly."

All credit cards charge an annual percentage rate on the unpaid balance, and some offer a low rate for a short period of time to attract new customers. Some credit cards also charge an annual fee. Then, there are fees for late payment and cash advances. It is necessary to compare the costs to determine the best offer rather than accept a credit card that has a high interest rate, a high annual fee, and high fees for penalties.

It is important to use credit wisely to avoid potential late fees, interest charges, and credit score decreases that can make it difficult to qualify for loans. These are all possible results of using credit poorly. They are not results of dropping out of school or going to college.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Use the credit card to pay for routine expenses and pay the balance in full each month. By paying a credit card in full each month, the cardholder can establish a positive credit history and avoid the extra cost of interest. Charging a large amount to the card and making minimum payments would cause interest to accrue on the account and put the cardholder at risk of developing poor credit. Since student loans are not typically charged interest until graduation, it is not beneficial to transfer that debt to a credit card that would begin charging interest right away."

A credit agency is a business that maintains files of credit information on individuals and businesses. It is important to make sure that credit agencies have accurate information about your credit history because other businesses purchase the reports to make decisions about extending credit to you or providing a loan to you. Although people can provide information to improve their credit ratings, it is the credit agencies that change or update the information. Good credit reports can increase the chances of obtaining a bank loan, but reviewing the reports cannot ensure that people obtain bank loans. People who monitor their credit reports can reduce the risk of identity theft, but cannot eliminate the risk."

      "explanation": "Arrange for the post office to hold your mail while you're out of town on vacation. People tend to associate identity theft with computer hacking; however, thieves often use very simple methods to steal others' personal and financial information. One of the easiest ways to steal confidential or personal information is by simply taking a person's mail from their mailbox. Rather than waiting to pick up your mail until your mailbox is full, you should get your mail from your mailbox on a daily basis. If you know that you are not going to be home to get your mail because you will be away for an extended period of time, such as on vacation, you should make arrangements for the post office to hold your mail while you're gone. Including your return address on all of your outgoing mail is a wise practice, but doing so won't necessarily prevent mail identity theft. Applying for as many credit cards as possible is likely to increase your chances of falling victim to mail identity theft, not lower it."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A senior manager tells a stakeholder that the government did not approve a new product because it did not meet safety standards. When a group of people has access to nonpublic information (material information) and makes trades based on this knowledge, those individuals have an unfair advantage over others. If the insider (senior manager) gives this information to others (stakeholders) so they can make trades based on the knowledge, both parties could be prosecuted for insider trading. In the example, the company's stock values are likely to be affected by the problems with a new product. When an employee shares material information with a person outside the company and who can act on the knowledge before it is revealed to the general public, it is an example of illegal insider trading. On the other hand, officers and board members of a company who buy or sell their own company's securities and report the trades to the SEC are not conducting illegal insider trading activities. Advising customers about mortgage rates, giving financial advice to a client, and providing an auditor with the company's material or financial information are not examples of insider trading."

One function of the SEC is to oversee the registration process for corporations when they first offer stock to the public, which is called initial public offerings or IPOs.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Evaluate the author's level of credibility. When conducting research for a business, it is important to consider the source's level of credibility. A person who has extensive knowledge of or expertise in a specific topic is more credible and more likely to present valid or reliable information. For example, an article about the side effects of a medication tends to be more credible if it was written by a doctor or pharmacist rather than if the article was written by a financial planner or mechanic. Although the timeliness of written material is a consideration, it is not related to the author's level of expertise. A researcher cannot always determine the author's level of emotional intelligence by reading a written document. And, it is possible to possess a high level of knowledge about a subject and have low emotional intelligence. The way in which the article is written, rather the author's expertise, will impact the understandability of the information."

Inflation may occur when demand exceeds supply or when productivity declines and costs of labor go up. Deflation, on the other hand, is a steady decline in the general price levels of goods and services over time. Balance of trade is the difference between the value of a nation's exports and its imports. Behavior modeling is an instructional method in which trainees are given a specific model of behavior, told the consequences of failure to perform in that manner, provided opportunities to practice the behavior, and evaluated using the behavior.

      "explanation": "Secured. In a secured, or collateral, loan, the borrower pledges to the lender some valuable possession as collateral, or security, to guarantee that the loan will be repaid. If the borrower does not repay the loan, the item that was used as collateral will then belong to the lender. Among the items that are often used as collateral are real estate, stocks and bonds, personal property such as machinery or cars, and the cash value of life insurance. An unsecured loan, also known as a signature loan, is an amount of money borrowed by an individual or a business simply by signing a promissory note, a written promise to repay the loan. In this type of loan, the borrower is not required to put up collateral. Installment credit accounts are designed to handle one total amount of credit, which is paid in installments within a certain time period.

A borrower must apply for the loan with the lender and provide the lender with necessary financial status information. The lender reviews this information to determine if the potential borrower is a good risk and is likely to pay back the loan. If the lender determines that the borrower meets the necessary criteria, the application is accepted and the loan process begins. The lender develops a formal document (contract) that the borrower must sign. The document contains information regarding the loan repayment terms and schedules. The contract does not include a tax code list, a proposal (request) for disbursement, or a guarantee of eminent domain."

      "explanation": "12.8%. The lender is required to inform a borrower of the finance charge that is to be paid on their installment loans, as well as the annual percentage rate (APR) for the loan. To calculate the approximate APR for Annie's loan, first find the total installment cost for the loan by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of payments and then adding this answer to the down payment for the loan ($283.27 X 24 = $6,798.48 + $0 = $6,798.48). Then, find the finance charge\u2014the total interest that Annie will be required to pay on the loan\u2014by subtracting the amount of the loan from the total installment cost ($6,798.48 - $6,000 = $798.48). To find the approximate APR, multiply the finance charge by 24, which is a constant in the formula for approximate APR ($798.48 X 24 = $19,163.52). Next, add one (also a constant in the formula) to the number of payments (1 + 24 = 25). Multiply this sum by the amount financed (25 X $6,000 = $150,000). Finally, divide this answer into $19,163.52 ($19,163.52 / $150,000 = 0.128 = 12.8%)."

      "explanation": "$807.53. Richard's gross pay consists of his total income for the week before income taxes and other deductions are subtracted from his pay. To determine Richard's total gross pay for last week, first multiply his standard 40 hours worked by his regular hourly rate (40 X $14.55 = $582.00). Then, determine his hourly rate for overtime hours by multiplying his regular hourly rate by 1.5 ($14.55 X 1.5 = $21.825). Next, multiply the number of overtime hours by the hourly rate for overtime (5 X $21.825 = $109.125). To calculate his hourly rate for holiday hours, multiply the regular hourly rate by two ($14.55 X 2 = $29.10). Multiply his hourly rate for holiday hours by the number of hours worked on New Year's Day, which is a holiday ($29.10 X 4 = $116.40).

When individuals make investments, they receive purchase documents that include information about the cost of the investment and any commissions or fees that were paid. Individuals should keep these documents in their records to verify ownership and to be able to determine if it was a good investment over a period of time. For example, the purchase record would indicate the cost (perhaps it was $25 a share), the total amount purchased (100 shares for a total of $2,500), and a fee of $30. By comparing the purchase records to actual value in five years, an individual will be able to decide if the investment was worthwhile. Perhaps the cost per share is $40 a share in five years.

Credit is the arrangement by which a person purchases now and pays later. A lending institution issues credit cards, which allow people to purchase now and pay later. The lender provides credit card users with a limit within which they can charge purchases. The lender pays for the purchases and then sends the credit card user a bill/statement each month that indicates the monthly minimum payment and interest charges due to the lender. It is important for people to pay credit card balances responsibly so they do not accumulate so much debt that they cannot afford to pay the lender. Using credit for purchases helps a person build a personal credit history, which lenders consider when a person applies for a large loan to purchase a car or a house. An asset is something of value that a person owns. Credit is not an asset or a tax. Because credit is so widely used, it is not necessarily a privilege."

Employees contribute to their 401(k) plans on a pretax basis, and many employers match employees' contributions up to a certain percentage. Both the employee's and employer's contributions become part of the employee's nest-egg for retirement. A traditional IRA (individual retirement account) is a personal savings plan that an employee can set up independent of their employer. Contributions to a traditional IRA are usually tax deductible, but the money in the account is taxed when it is withdrawn during retirement. Money contributed to a Roth IRA is not tax deductible, but the money withdrawn from a Roth IRA during retirement is not taxed.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Use secure web browsers when purchasing online. Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because internet sales transactions often require a person to provide credit card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure websites reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes up because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others. When more people know an individual's banking information, the risk of identity theft increases. Everyday cash transactions do not require a purchaser to provide personal information and, therefore, do not pose a high risk for identity theft."

Sherise's potential financial advisor charges an asset management fee of 1.5% per year.

A mutual fund is a collection of shareholders' money that is invested by professional fund managers in an assortment of different securities, such as stocks and bonds. Because the money is spread out over different types of investments, it provides the investor with a diversified portfolio. If one stock performs poorly, the investor still has many other types of investments in the fund that may be performing well, which reduces the risk of severe financial losses. Corporations sell corporate bonds to investors as a way to raise cash for their businesses. The corporation (borrower) pays back the full amount plus interest to the investor within a certain time. A certificate of deposit is a type of lending investment in which the investor lends the money to the bank at a set interest rate for a particular period of time.

      "explanation": "The previous day's closing price was $34.39, $0.62 less than the last price for today. To calculate the previous day's closing price, investors can subtract the net change (the difference between the closing price and the previous day's closing price) from the last price for the day ($35.01 - $0.62 = $34.39). The price/earnings ratio (P/E) indicates how much higher the stock share price is than its earnings per share. So, Home Depot's stock share price is 18.92 times higher than its earnings per share. The lowest price paid for Home Depot stock during the last year was $26.62.

An emergency fund should be 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in case you lose your source of income or have an unplanned expense. It is not an appropriate savings tool for study abroad. A 401(k) is a retirement account that you most likely cannot access until you have reached retirement age, so it would not be appropriate for this situation. A certificate of deposit is an agreement with a bank to deposit money for a fixed period of time, during which the bank will pay you interest.

Financial transactions are not always between two individual people, nor are they always taxed at a high rate."

        "late fees and interest charges.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Late fees and interest charges. It is important to pay your credit card bills in full each month because interest charges and fees can quickly accumulate if you pay late. There are penalties and consequences of failing to pay your credit card bills on time; you will receive interest charges and/or late fees, and your credit score may decrease. It is unlikely that you would be fired from your job because you failed to pay your credit card bills on time, since employers do not have access to your credit information."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Forbearance. With this option, you and your loan provider agree to temporarily suspend or reduce your monthly payments for a specific period of time. Forbearance lets you deal with your short-term financial problems by giving you time to get back on your feet before resuming payments. Bankruptcy is a process that allows consumers and businesses to repay some or all of their debts under the protection of the federal bankruptcy court. Filing for bankruptcy is a last-resort option and is not a process that should be pursued to relieve temporary hardship. Reimbursement and loan subsidy are not options for postponing loan payments."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "You only make minimum payments on bills. Only paying the minimum amount due each month means that, in the future, you are expected to pay both the balance due and an additional fee for interest. For someone paying the minimum each month, paying off this additional money is difficult, so it becomes an endless cycle of debt. Having an emergency fund, even small, is not necessarily an indicator of excessive debt. Many people in excessive debt don't know actually how much they owe; chances are, if they \u201chide\u201d from their debt, they have a large amount they are afraid they cannot pay. Another sign of excessive debt is if your credit cards are generally declined, not accepted."

      "explanation": "Verify its accuracy. A credit report is a record of your credit history. Businesses and individuals can obtain their credit reports from authorized credit bureaus. The advantage to reviewing your credit report on a regular basis is that you can verify that the information is correct. Incorrect information can affect your ability to obtain credit or a loan, so it is important to check for and correct any inaccurate information that you find in your credit report. Businesses and individuals can improve their credit scores by using credit wisely and by taking action to correct inaccurate information; however, they cannot change credit scores\u2014only authorized credit bureaus can do so. Credit card issuers set credit limits and often review your credit report to determine the amount of credit they are willing to extend to you. Credit reports do not identify discriminatory practices."

Company B is offering a salary of $45,000 and also contributes an amount equal to 10% of an employee's salary to their retirement fund after they have been employed for a year. Which of the following employees would benefit the most by working for Company B:",

        "Someone who will work less than one year"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Someone who is not personally disciplined to save for retirement. If a person lacks the discipline to save for retirement, working for a company that makes retirement contributions on their behalf is ideal. An employee working for Company B would receive a salary of $45,000 plus 10% of their salary, which equals $4,500 per year. The total financial gains received from Company B starting in year two would equal $49,500, which is only $500 less in overall compensation than Company A offers. People who are skilled at investing or disciplined to save for retirement may benefit more from the slightly larger salary offered by Company A. A person who will work less than one year will not gain the $4,500 retirement contribution, so they would gain much more income from Company A."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Contributions are deducted before earnings are taxed. Deducting contributions from earnings reduces taxable income, which also lowers the amount of tax withheld from a person's paychecks. Contributions to a 401(k) are not taxed when they are contributed, but are taxed upon withdrawal instead. Net earnings are not taxed. While many employers match 401(k) contributions, doing so doesn't reduce the taxes withheld from a person's paycheck."

It takes into account the interest rates, the length of the loan agreement, and other fees or charges. If you have a lower APR, your monthly payments will be lower.

Personal loans are a type of unsecured loan\u2014an amount of money borrowed by an individual simply by signing a written promise to repay the loan. Because they are considered high-risk loans, personal loans tend to have high interest rates and are generally reserved for people with excellent credit ratings.

Eating dinner at home would be the cheapest option, but then Jared would not see his friends. Going out to dinner but not leaving a tip is considered rude and might not save Jared that much money.

      "explanation": "The project manager can tell him what a real day on the job is like. Perry can gain many benefits from doing an informational interview with a current project manager. The project manager can tell him what their typical work day is like, what sort of education or training they had, what they like or dislike about the job, and what sorts of skills it takes to excel in their position. Personal information like this may help Perry decide whether or not project management is the profession for him. Perry shouldn't assume the project manager will give him a job, although having a connection may come in handy when he's job hunting many years down the road. The project manager will not be able to make Perry's decisions for him; all they can do is tell Perry about their experience. It's probably not a good idea for Perry to expect the project manager to help him with his application; after all, it's a pretty big favor to ask someone to speak with him.
