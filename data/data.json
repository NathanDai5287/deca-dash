If Alex Smith is a woman, she might be offended if Rosa uses \u201cDear Mr. Smith.\u201d \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d shouldn't ever be used. It's important to find out to whom to address the letter, even if it's just to a title, such as \u201cVice President.\u201d In Rosa's case, she knows the name of the recipient, so she should use that. \u201cDear Alex\u201d is too informal for a business letter.

Even though the person is behaving in an unacceptable manner, they may have a legitimate complaint that needs attention. Taking time to identify the problem is the first step in solving it. The employee should not interrupt the customer unless absolutely necessary. The employee also should not tell the customer to be quiet or to come back when they are calmer."

A pair of shoes rising in price over one year is an example of inflation\u2014not shifting trends, deflation, or advertising power.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Negative work culture. Tacit knowledge is expertise that is often difficult to explain or quantify. Businesses with positive work cultures tend to encourage openness and sharing, which builds trust among employees. When coworkers trust one another and feel valued by their employers, they are more likely to share their tacit knowledge with one another. Negative work environments tend to foster a distrustful environment, which often discourages employees from sharing their expertise. In these situations, employees are often fearful about losing their jobs and are more likely to keep helpful information to themselves. An unsatisfactory credit rating, uncooperative vendors, and poor customer service levels are not primary reasons why employees withhold tacit knowledge from coworkers."

      "explanation": "Email. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight, and information of internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. The key to effective knowledge management is getting employees to share their \"personal know-how\" with managers and coworkers. Technology is often used to capture and share this knowledge. The best way for Kendra to share her discovery is by email. She can construct her message and send it to many people at one time. Kendra would probably not post this information on the company's website, because this information is not meaningful to customers or website visitors. A relational database stores linked or related information. Calling each coworker is not as efficient as sending an email message."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Reverse engineering. Reverse engineering is the process of examining the makeup of an existing product on the market. By reviewing the components of the product through independent discovery, a competitor can apply the findings to recreate the product. Although this is a legal practice under trade secret laws in Canada and the United States, it does hinder the ability to maintain trade secrets for certain types of processes, ingredients, etc. Process fragmentation involves limiting the amount of information employees have about an entire process, which lessens the risk that the company's trade secret will be revealed. Copyrights legally protect written and artistic works rather than trade secrets. Therefore, any reforms to copyright laws would not affect trade secrets. Systematic neutralizing is a fictitious term."

      "explanation": "Task analysis. Businesses use many techniques to capture employees' knowledge. One technique involves observing an employee while they are performing their job and taking notes about each step in the process. The purpose of task analysis is to obtain a deeper understanding of the job task. Participation involves actually carrying out the steps in a process or job task to gain knowledge. Learning histories are similar to lessons learned summaries or debriefings. This involves reviewing important events that have occurred and documenting the successes and mistakes experienced during the event. The learning histories can help other managers gain insights when they encounter similar situations in the future. Organizations use the laddering technique to collect and organize knowledge in a hierarchical manner."

      "explanation": "Plan future business activities. Customer records (e.g., invoices) help businesses determine what customers are buying, when they are buying, and how much they are buying. Analyzing past sales records (e.g., invoices) helps a business forecast future sales, which aids in planning other activities such as promotion. Businesses do not keep customer records so that they can negotiate with competitors. To obtain a favorable credit rating, a business must pay its bills when they are due. Maintaining records provides information about customers' purchasing habits, but the records themselves do not increase brand loyalty."

The trend toward protecting the environment is forcing many businesses to correct the problem and find ways of operating that will not be destructive.

      "explanation": "To make it accessible. Businesses obtain a wide variety of information that often can be used for many purposes. Therefore, it is important to store the information for future use so it will be accessible when needed. For example, information about current customers might be used to develop procedures for attracting new customers in the future. If the information has not been stored so it is accessible, the business will need to obtain other types of information. Businesses do not need to store information to establish quality control. Storing information does not ensure that data is accurate, nor does it ensure that the information remains confidential."

If something goes wrong while she's moving the data into the new system, this will help her avoid losing all that information. She should tell employees about the change before it occurs. She should wait to delete the old system until after she installs the new one. This way, she'll be less likely to lose information if something goes wrong.

A significant number of workplace injuries are the result of slipping, tripping, and falling on unsafe walking and work surfaces (e.g., floors, stairs, sidewalks, loading docks, etc.). One way that businesses can reduce these accidents is by salting or sanding icy patches on their sidewalks, parking lots, loading docks, and outdoor wheelchair ramps during winter weather. Employees and customers are likely to trip or fall on extension cords that run across main walkways in the business, boxes of inventory stored in stairwells and in front of emergency exits, and protruding file drawers in high traffic areas."

Although the dollar amount of each theft is small, the total can add up to a considerable loss for a business. Pilferage is a security problem because it can cause financial losses that threaten the security of the business. Burglary is any illegal entry into a building to commit a theft.

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Poor supply chain management can result in customer dissatisfaction. Poor supply chain management would likely lead to many problems for all members of a supply chain, such as order fulfillment delays and product quality issues. These issues would most likely result in customer dissatisfaction, not customer satisfaction. Good supply chain management would lead to increased value for customers since product issues would be less likely. Good supply chain management is likely to result in sustainable business practices, not unsustainable business practices."

To protect customer data, Tanner should only ask for the customer information he needs the most so he does not unnecessarily collect private data that are not needed. This technique will help him limit the risk associated with collecting data. It is not a good idea to refrain from sharing the nature of the survey, because it is best to be open and transparent with customers. Tanner should not store the data for any future use because to protect customers, their data should only be used for the intended purpose.

This helps effectively manage time, so work can be done at a relaxed pace. Generally, employees who plan out their work and manage their time do not have to worry about tight deadlines. Planning work often leads to greater productivity and efficiency, which means an employee is less likely to impose on coworkers for help to complete a task or project on time. An organized employee is also more focused on their tasks, making it less likely that they get distracted or sidetracked while working."

One way of getting an interview is for applicants to specify in their letters a time that they will call to discuss the possibility of scheduling an interview. Taking the initiative often helps job applicants obtain the interviews they need. By law, job applicants do not need to provide personal information about age, marital status, children, etc. Therefore, it is unlikely that an applicant would call to provide unrequested information.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Prevents the duplication of work. Creating a work breakdown structure (WBS) involves dividing project tasks into meaningful components to complete the project. Dividing the entire project into smaller components helps the project manager identify tasks and effectively schedule, assign, and monitor complex project activities. By dividing the work into smaller packages, the project manager defines each task and the team member(s) who will perform the tasks, which prevents the duplication of work. Project managers cannot eliminate unexpected circumstances, although they must be able to handle them. Developing a WBS does not reduce the need to set project milestones (incremental goals) or decrease the need to manage project tasks."

The team leader should communicate the performance standards, which are specifications or statements that serve as a basis for comparing the desired performance with the actual performance. By understanding the standards, team members can adapt their behavior and use techniques or processes to perform the work in ways that will achieve the desired level of quality. Depending on the project and the team members' responsibilities, the performance standards may include using financial information or marketing strategies.

If focused on individual employees, the automated oversight technology tracks each employee's activity to determine if and when they exceed the preset risk limit. If the employee exceeds their limit, the software notifies management immediately. Management can then take the necessary actions to reduce the risk exposure.

Because hiring and training employees is an expense for businesses, they should ensure that the applicants' previous work experiences do not present business risks for them. Because applicants are unlikely to discuss unfavorable past work experiences during an interview, businesses need to take action to verify the information on their employment applications. Employers should confirm the applicants' previous employment, verify their references, and conduct background checks on applicants if needed. CopyIt may have reduced its liability by checking the drivers' previous driving records and employment history before extending job offers to them. There is not enough information provided to determine if the accidents involve substance abuse, so mandating monthly drug testing for all employees may not prevent future driving accidents.

      "explanation": "Learning doesn't always lead to knowledge. Learning and knowledge are related, but they are not the same. Learning is the process of being exposed to new concepts and skills; knowledge is the information that is internalized and mastered through learning. Unfortunately, learning does not always lead to knowledge\u2014much of what we learn is forgotten. In this way, learning\u2014not knowledge\u2014is fleeting. Businesses, therefore, should be mindful about how they train their employees. Training should always attempt to lead to maximum knowledge retention. Not all training sessions are useless, but many do not lead to maximum knowledge retention."

Failure to include certain members of an organization in a change process can lead to distrust and low morale among those that are excluded. To be successful, change management must include everyone.

      "explanation": "They clearly outline both sides of an agreement. Legally binding contracts are meant to clearly outline an agreement. This way, disputes and litigation can hopefully be avoided. Legally binding contracts don't actually have to be written; they can still be valid if they're verbal, but they're much easier to prove if they are in writing. Breaking a contract doesn't always result in a lawsuit or jail time. In fact, most people avoid lawsuits at all costs since they tend to be expensive and lengthy. Contracts are only enforceable for legal acts."

By buying stock in an open corporation, John can become a business owner without daily involvement in the business. In addition, shareholders in an open corporation are only liable for the amount they invest in the company. Sole proprietorship is a form of ownership that requires owner participation. General partnership combines the capital, experience, and abilities of two or more people. Sole proprietorships and general partnerships involve unlimited liability. A close (private) corporation does not offer stock for sale to the general public. In many cases, the shareholders manage and operate the business, which means the owners participate in the day-to-day activities of the business."

Individuals who are partners in a business should have a partnership agreement, even though it is not required by law, because it does help the partners prevent future problems. It should include such points as the rights, responsibilities, and contributions of each partner; the division of authority and profit for each partner; the length of the partnership agreement; and the actions to take if a partner dies or becomes unable to continue the business. Stock is sold for corporations, not for partnerships. The partnership agreement does not affect taxes."

For example, suppose a business's employee intentionally provides misleading product information to a customer to make a sale. Then, the customer purchases and is injured by the product based on the employee's misleading information. The customer may file a civil lawsuit against the business, and in some situations, the business's employee for fraudulent behavior. Assault and intrusion are criminal acts that are addressed in the criminal court system rather than the civil court system. Defamation is a tort that involves harm to an individual's or business's reputation."

An industrial user is a business that buys materials, services, or goods that will be used to make other goods or used in the operation of the company. A construction company, for instance, must buy lumber, steel, and other materials needed to build homes and offices.

Exclusive distribution would make this product less available to the everyday consumer, as in the case of upscale cars or clothing, and is impractical for this type of product. Inclusive distribution is not a recognized distribution strategy. Selective distribution is a balance between intensive and exclusive distribution, such as the sale of certain power tools only through one or two retailers, and like exclusive distribution, it is impractical for dishwashing soap."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "To use touchpoints to create positive customer experiences. The brand promise is a company's agreement (spoken or unspoken) with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand characteristics and values. To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand promise should strive to create positive experiences for customers\u2014experiences that will encourage them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touchpoints to create these experiences for their customers. Touchpoints are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touchpoints may include the company's employees, product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., phone, website). A slogan (tag line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as \"Nationwide is on your side.\" A trade character is a symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition. One reason that businesses establish certain types of policies (e.g., sales, service) is to ensure that customers are treated fairly. Establishing different policies for different customers is not treating customers fairly, and in some circumstances, such actions are illegal."

In this case, buying in bulk is what has increased in scale. Marginal cost is the change in total cost that occurs when the quantity produced changes by one unit. The law of diminishing returns indicates that as more and more units of an input are added to production, the per person output decreases. With a tying agreement, a vendor ties the sale of one good to a customer agreeing to buy a second good. No evidence is provided that a tying agreement has been set up."

      "explanation": "Buy the furniture because rental costs will exceed the purchase price in 1.97 years. To determine whether to rent or buy office furniture, the small-business owner needs to first calculate the annual cost of renting the furniture. To do this, multiply the monthly rate of $275 by the number of employees needing furniture (6). This provides the total monthly rental expense: $275 X 6 = $1,650. Next, multiply the total monthly rental expense by 12, the number of months in a year: $1,650 X 12 = $19,800. Now, determine how much the small-business owner would pay if they bought the furniture. Multiply the furniture cost per person by the number of people needing furniture: $6,500 X 6 = $39,000. Finally, divide the furniture's total cost by the annual rental rate to determine how many years it would take for the cost of the rented furniture to exceed the cost of the purchased furniture: $39,000 / $19,800 = 1.97 years. In a little less than two years, the cost of the rental furniture will exceed the cost of the purchased furniture. If the small-business owner has the money, it would be worthwhile for them to buy rather than rent the office furniture."

      "explanation": "Resources are often limited. When a venture is first starting out, resources are usually limited because the company is not yet making a profit or generating revenue. Therefore, it's important to use resources productively to keep the venture going. Investors do not necessarily expect immediate returns. Using resources productively does not necessarily build brand loyalty or improve marketing efforts."

When international customers discover and enjoy that new business's products, sales often increase. A business operating in several different countries will have more cultural barriers to deal with because customer preferences, traditions, and trends vary from country to country. When a business operates in many countries, it faces more compliance challenges since it must deal with a greater number of and more types of regulations imposed by different countries (e.g., ingredients and packaging used for products). Business expansion into international markets exposes a business to more financial risk since different currencies, tariffs, and shipping fees often reduce profits."

Common-sized statements use percentages for the purposes of comparing one company to another within an industry or one company to overall industry averages. Percentages are used for comparison purposes because the relative sizes of companies can make it difficult to use dollar figures, for example. Horizontal analysis is also used for comparison, but it is most often used to compare the same pieces of information as they have changed from one period to another within a single company. Percentages are also often used in vertical analysis, but they are used to show what percentage of a general category is made up of a single item (e.g., what percentage of total assets are long-term assets). These percentages can then be compared across time but are not as often used to compare businesses to one another. Trend analysis is a method that uses data from the past to predict future data.

      "explanation": "Employees may already have a solution to the problem. Managers should try to obtain employee input when resolving a complaint because the employees may already have a solution to the problem, and they tend to support what they help create. Managers must keep in mind that employees may not be objective about a situation in which they are involved and that they have their own best interests at heart. Since many factors are usually involved in a problem, the employees may know the results, or effects, of the problem without knowing its true cause. Asking for employee input in resolving a problem is not always the easiest way to handle it and may create additional problems, rather than quickly resolving the initial problem."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The results of punishing undesirable behavior are unpredictable. Supervisors cannot predict how employees will react to remedial action. When properly administered, remedial action should affect behavior without unintended complications. While some employees may, after discipline, be hostile toward the supervisor or continue to commit rule violations, disciplinary cases often end without incident. Psychological studies have shown that behavior that is rewarded is likely to be repeated. When discipline policies are communicated to employees when they begin working for the business, appropriate forms of discipline should not cause individuals great psychological damage if disciplinary action occurs."

      "explanation": "Creating a positive work environment. A business's overall work environment is affected by the work culture, which is the way the organization operates with regard to its treatment of employees and those outside the business. Owners and managers who treat employees respectfully, listen to their feedback, communicate openly, and reward good performance tend to foster a positive work culture. In a positive work culture, employees are more willing to work together to meet the business's goals. Competition is a rivalry. Consensus is a decision-making outcome that requires the substantial agreement of each group member.

The more advertisers know about their customers, the more they can effectively target their audiences. Advertisers go beyond demographic information and are continually trying to find ways to learn more behavioral information about their customers. Having increasingly large amounts of information about customers makes record keeping a greater challenge, necessitating the use of databases. Some advertisers sell customer information to other companies, but an increasing number recognize this practice as an invasion of their customers' privacy. Most companies of any size will not be able to recognize each and every one of their customers. The best they can do is to understand various groups of customers in terms of their behavior, interests, and preferences."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is intended to group data points into groups or clusters. The goal here is to allow observable data to naturally collect into groups that are largely homogenous, share a set of characteristics, and are unlike the data in other groups or clusters. These clusters, when used to sort consumers, create market segments that can be targeted with marketing. Market basket analysis focuses on establishing links between data points that tend to occur together. This is often used in determining which items tend to be purchased together (placed in a \u201cmarket basket\u201d together). Prediction analysis, such as regression analysis, involves using independent or predictor variables to anticipate a response of a dependent variable. Forecasting analysis seeks to make predictions about specific time periods based on historical observations and other considerations."

      "explanation": "Fire extinguishers. Businesses should keep fire extinguishers on the premises and make sure that all employees know where they are located. In the event that a fire breaks out, employees should be able to find the extinguishers quickly and attempt to put out the fire while another employee calls the fire department. Knowing where the fire extinguishers are and reacting quickly often prevents a fire from spreading and reduces the amount of damage. Fire-prevention programs do not require employees to know the location of all electrical outlets or hazardous materials. Employees should have easy access to the phone numbers of emergency services, rather than knowing the location of those services."

It might seem that a business would always choose the highest selling price. However, a business might decide that setting a lower price would increase sales, thereby recovering costs and making a profit more quickly.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Pay a $2,000 security deposit to lease a facility. Many new businesses have limited amounts of cash available to cover the costs of purchasing property, which usually include a down payment, closing costs, taxes, etc. On the other hand, the initial cash expense for leasing is often limited to a security deposit and the first rent payment. When cash is limited, it is usually more economical for new businesses to pay a $2,000 security deposit to lease rather than buy a facility because it saves them money. If businesses have sufficient cash, it is more economical in the long run to negotiate a 9.5% interest rate and make a $50,000 down payment to buy rather than lease. Paying a year's rent in advance is not economical for a business that has limited cash flow."

To ensure the efficient production and distribution of products, companies should monitor the performance of all supply chain partners on a consistent basis. Companies should not ignore underperforming vendors\u2014they should work with them to resolve the problem(s) or else replace them. Companies must be careful when introducing new innovations or changes to the production process. Introducing change too quickly can overwhelm the supply chain, resulting in failure to meet production quotas.

      "explanation": "Detect trends. Business analysis is the process of investigating and evaluating a business issue, problem, process, or approach. Businesses analyze financial data to evaluate the financial well-being of their operations at any given time. By comparing the same type of financial information from different consecutive time periods, a business can detect trends. By detecting trends, the business can determine if it needs to make changes. For example, if the business notices a substantial increase in sales-dollar volume over a three-month period, trends indicate an increase in spending. The business may decide to conduct further analysis to determine what customers are purchasing, and decide if it needs to increase the production or inventory levels of certain products. Businesses analyze markets for many reasons, but they cannot control market activity. To analyze its competitors, a business needs to obtain and review external data. Comparing internal financial data cannot influence buying behavior."

        "Final customers who buy the supply chain's end product"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Final customers who buy the supply chain's end product. The sales revenue generated by customers purchasing a supply chain's end product is the only true income source for an entire supply chain. As a result, customer satisfaction is one of the most important factors in supply chain management. Profit generated from purchases made within the supply chain does not add income to the supply chain. The only source for any money that is generated through participation in a supply chain must come from the ultimate sale of the end product. Without this sale, no supply chain member will be able to receive revenues. Raw materials used in manufacturing play into the expenses side of the supply chain, but there are more expenses than just the raw materials. Because the only revenue created must come from the final customer, many aspects of supply chain management involve limiting expenses up to the point where the customers' expectations for the final product are still being met, but not beyond. Neither investments nor loans are commonly considered income for a business."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Lets them know why they succeeded or failed. Processes are sets of steps used to reach an outcome. Process thinking means keeping processes in mind throughout a project or business venture. Process thinking helps organizations know why they succeeded or failed because they can look back at and assess the process that was used, which is usually the cause of success or failure. Process thinking does not enable organizations to find out who to blame for issues, because it shifts the focus from people to processes. Process thinking encourages documentation, rather than helping organizations avoid it. Finally, process thinking encourages collaboration between departments, rather than keeping work separate."

In fact, some might argue that controlling costs is the driving force of supply chain management. It is also likely the area where supply chain managers have the most control. Controlling costs has many secondary benefits as well, such as creating value, contributing to profit maximization, and aiding in organizational stability. Developing overseas markets and producing an appealing corporate image are unlikely to be the direct results of supply chain management. Gaining leverage in negotiations is a possible outcome for supply chain managers but is not likely to be a top priority and will not apply to all supply chain managers."

Creative thinking is thinking in a creative way, using the creative-thinking process. Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analyzing of data about problems relating to the marketing of goods and services. The purpose of cause-related advertising is to create awareness about social causes (e.g., poverty) rather than to promote products."

Quality assurance is an organization-wide system that businesses use to ensure that products meet quality standards; it includes quality control, but its scope is much bigger than just that. Quality improvement involves an organization\u2019s willingness to change and adapt for the purpose of maintaining quality. Quality command is not a common aspect of quality management."

      "explanation": "ERM focuses on the combined impact of all risks. Enterprise risk management takes into account all of the risks that an organization may face and looks at their combined impact. Not all risks are negative; risks can be positive, and positive risks must be considered as well as negative risks. Enterprise risk management does not make it more difficult to achieve goals; in fact, it can help an organization achieve its goals. Risks are not usually related to relationships between employees; there are many types of risks related to all aspects of an organization."

A manager who shows impartiality and has the ability to make judgments without showing favoritism or demonstrating self-interest is exhibiting fair and ethical behavior. In other words, the manager is able to use the same criteria to judge all employees rather than give special consideration to a few. Being emotional, feeling inferior, and expressing criticism usually do not impact the ability to behave ethically."

If one of those goals is to increase customer satisfaction by 15%, an effective measure of progress toward that goal is the number of product returns. As the business increases its customers' satisfaction with its goods and services, the number of product returns should decrease\u2014because satisfied customers are happy with their purchases and less likely to return or exchange the items. Although increased marketing efforts, more touchpoints, and less employee turnover may increase customer satisfaction, they are not effective measures of the resulting customer satisfaction."

It typically involves scammers who buy a small stock and then hype it up to other investors, causing its price to rise. The scammers sell when the price is high, leaving the victims to deal with the rapid price decline afterwards. A pyramid scheme is an illegal form of multi-level marketing in which emphasis is placed on collecting initial fees from as many people as possible. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that lures in new investors by promising high rates of return with little to no risk.

Much more data must be maintained by the financial-information management system for longer periods of time as a result of new laws and regulations.

Small-business owners do not necessarily have the same level of risk because they are not always focused as strongly on innovation. The size of the workforce does not necessarily differentiate between small-business owners and entrepreneurs. Both small businesses and entrepreneurs create jobs and have a positive impact on economic growth."

The demand for the products of non-cyclical industries (e.g., food, beverage, tobacco, healthcare) tends to remain consistent throughout all phases of the business cycle. Therefore, the stock performance of non-cyclical industries tends to remain steady throughout all stages of the business cycle, as well. Changes in the business cycle tend to affect the stock prices of other industries, including energy and capital goods. The energy sector (e.g., oil) is affected by the global supply and demand, which influences energy stock performance. Historically, energy stocks tend to perform best late in the business cycle. Capital goods stocks tend to perform well during the expansion phase of the business cycle because businesses are expanding and buying equipment."

Emerging markets are growing markets (e.g., stock, bond, commodities, etc.) that result when a country initiates reforms that move it from a closed economy to an open or market economy. Because the markets are new, they are untried and relatively unstable, which is a high risk for investors. However, these markets also have the potential to provide investors with high returns, as the country's business activity increases and its economy grows. Developing countries tend to experience gains in gross domestic product due to higher production and business activity, which is often facilitated by high foreign investment.

The business may need to find a vendor that charges less for the materials or parts, or it may need to increase its selling price\u2014the amount that the business charges its customers for the finished good. Fixed overhead costs are expenses that do not change in relation to changes in sales volume and include things such as rent and employee salaries. Material yield analysis involves analyzing variances in the number of materials/products that are supposed to be used/sold with the actual number of materials/products that have been used/sold in a certain time frame."

      "explanation": "Variance analysis. Variance analysis involves determining the difference between actual and planned behavior. In terms of accounting, it involves determining how much actual numbers differ from those projected in the budget. Managerial accountants can use this analysis technique to see how accurate their budgets are. Cost benefit analysis examines the costs and benefits of a certain decision. Marginal analysis explains the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that activity. Competitive analysis is the process of comparing a business's income statement with that of its competitors to see how it is doing by industry standards."

Credit card issuers may review the applicant's credit report, which provides details about the customer's payment history of other loans and bills. Another factor analyzed is the applicant's current level of debt, which might include current loan balances with other institutions.

Businesses display their products at trade shows and have staff on hand to answer questions. Trade shows offer an opportunity for businesses to present their products to many potential customers in one place and at one time. Businesses do not train their salespeople at trade shows. Although businesses may meet their competitors at trade shows, that is not the primary reason for participating. Businesses research their market before participating in trade shows.

However, the need for a board of directors does not change based on the size of the company; small companies can benefit from a board of directors as much as large companies.

Because advertising is a planned promotional activity, the use of overly aggressively advertising tactics is an intentional action. BTA used advertising to discredit MZT, which hurt MZT's sales. In response, MZT may file a lawsuit against BTA on the grounds of defamation, if the advertising contained false statements. Negligence involves unintentional or accidental wrongdoings such as a distracted driver causing a minor car accident.

Since there are no laws preventing airlines from overbooking flights, bumping passengers from flights is common when traveling by air. Several transportation agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Canadian Transportation Agency, among others, require that airlines first ask for volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for compensation. This may be in the form of cash or a voucher. The amount a passenger is compensated for lost luggage is subject to negotiation. Most airlines have a ceiling on the amount paid. Currently, there is no international \"Bill of Rights.\u201d However, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Transportation expanded its airline passenger protections to better safeguard passengers from lost baggage fees, overbooked flights, and hidden airline fees.

When making an oral presentation to a group, the speaker should speak loudly enough for everyone in the audience to hear what they are saying. If audience members cannot hear what the speaker is saying, they might misunderstand or misinterpret the message.

      "explanation": "Return. Most businesses in the hospitality industry rely on repeat customers to be profitable. Poor customer service is the primary reason that customers do not return to a business, so it is important that every customer receive good service every time. Goodwill is either the kindness of customers\u2014something a business cannot rely on to be profitable\u2014or an intangible asset related to a company purchase. Capital is wealth and is not directly related to customer service. While some customers might review businesses in the hospitality industry, their personal records will not determine the success of a business."

Therefore, her personality affects her customer service practices. This is not an example of how a company's culture affects its customer service. Extraverted people do not necessarily have a higher success rate in hospitality; many jobs in the field are well-suited for introverts.

Many people have dietary restrictions, so making sure that the airline could provide gluten-free meals is a way to accommodate the special needs of the couple. Not all clients will require calls to the airline about in-flight meals. Asking about in-flight meals is not related to the airline's contact information.

      "explanation": "Showing concern for customers' lengthy wait. A moment of truth in customer service is an interaction during which a customer can form a lasting impression of your company. One way that employees can create positive moments of truth is to demonstrate empathy and concern when customers are experiencing frustration. Customers who feel that the company cares about them will be more likely to form a positive impression. A customer-satisfaction survey will not necessarily create a positive moment of truth. Following a script when talking to customers can make the customer feel unimportant and unheard. Finally, aggressively upselling to customers does not necessarily create a positive moment of truth; rather, pushing costlier sales can create a negative impression."

      "explanation": "Transferring risk. Transferring risk occurs when the risk is shifted to another party. Purchasing an extended warranty transfers the risk of repairing defective automobiles from the buyer to the seller. A business retains risk when it decides to keep the risk. A business avoids risk when it recognizes risk and completely avoids it. Elevating risk refers to increasing risk."

      "explanation": "Fewer job. A trade deficit decreases the gross domestic product, which reflects the health of a nation's economy. A large trade deficit often leads to a lower standard of living and fewer job opportunities because the nation is importing more than it exports. A large trade deficit indicates a significant decrease in exports, an increase in imports, and less trade in general."

      "explanation": "It decreases the GDP. The underground economy consists of cash or barter transactions for which no receipts are kept. Since these amounts are not added to the gross domestic product (GDP), GDP is reduced. The underground economy does not cause economic declines, which occur when the GDP is not growing, or trade surpluses, which exist when a country exports more goods than it imports."

If businesses want to develop favorable relationships with foreign businesses, they need to recognize, understand, and respect other cultures. A business that does not learn about the cultural differences may do or say something to offend a foreign customer or potential customer. Political factors relate to government issues.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Increased sales. When tourism enters a new area, local businesses usually benefit from increased economic activity. Tourists who stay at a resort are likely to spend money elsewhere, and newly employed resort workers might also be encouraged to spend more at local shops. Property taxes would not necessarily increase because the taxes collected from the tourists themselves could lead to reduced local taxes. The quantity of goods is more likely to increase than decrease because the increased customers will lead to more demand for products. Finally, a new resort would not decrease the number of job openings in local shops. The increased economic activity would be more likely to add more jobs."

Getting people to change involves guiding or directing them to do something in a different way. People usually will not follow the lead of another person if that person cannot provide guidance or direction.

Although leadership styles vary, effective leaders tend to exhibit several common characteristics, one of which is a high level of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and manage your own emotions as well as those of others. This means that you are aware of your emotions, respond to them appropriately, and then do the same with the emotions of others. Shared vision is the ability to share a vision (e.g., better way of doing things) and use it to inspire others. Responsibility involves taking ownership of a problem, making sure it is fixed, and taking steps to prevent it from happening again. When a leader exhibits integrity, they adhere to an established set of personal ethics and sound moral principles in all situations."

Self-confident people are willing to take positive risks, which involve stepping out of their comfort zones. Self-confident people understand that mistakes are a part of life and do not let the risk of failure keep them from taking action.

Organizational culture is the standards, rituals, attitudes, and belief systems that create the workplace environment and influence the interactions within it. Organizational culture is the \u201ctone\u201d of the work environment. Because each business functions differently, each business has a unique culture. For example, one business environment might have a rigid chain of command, a strict dress code, an inflexible work schedule, and provide minimal information to employees. In such an environment, employees may feel creatively suppressed and suspicious of management, which often negatively affects employees' attitudes and productivity levels. On the other hand, a business that communicates well with employees, has flexible work schedules, and encourages suggestions and creativity tends to foster trust, which creates a positive work environment. The company's legal business structure (e.g., partnership, corporation) affects the company's tax obligation. Natural resources are items found in nature that the business uses to produce goods and services. Cognitive ability is the ability to learn and understand. Individuals, rather than companies, have various cognitive abilities."

Ethics aren't always black and white, and sometimes it can be challenging to know what to do or what is expected. Carter may have tried to model ethical behavior in regard to use of company supplies, but his employees were unaware of his expectations and did not know that their actions were unethical. This is likely due to unclear/inadequate communication. Carter did provide feedback to his employees. There is no indication that there were too many rules or that there was inconsistency in ethical principles."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It encourages managers to assess activities and adjust figures more frequently. A rolling (continuous) budget replaces each passing month with a new month added to the end of the budget, so there is always a year-long budget in place. Because a new month is added to the budget on a regular basis, managers need to assess and adjust figures on a monthly basis to reflect the various factors that influence business activities. By being able to change and adapt, the rolling budget provides the business with flexibility. The zero-based budgeting method requires managers to demonstrate the need for every expense. Although unexpected expenses do come up and should be a consideration when establishing any type of budget, a rolling budget does not provide managers with an advantage over other budgeting methods in terms of forecasting unexpected expenses. A rolling budget does not eliminate the need for a master budget. A master budget can be developed using the rolling budget methodology."

Although not always the case, high free cash flow can signal that the company is growing, while a negative free cash flow can be a sign that the company is suffering financially. Free cash flow is determined by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. To determine a business's working capital, subtract current liabilities from current assets.

It should face the situation head-on, take responsibility, and promise to investigate and fix the situation to ensure it won\u2019t happen again. This example does not illustrate using high-pressure sales techniques, failing to provide what customers want, or not keeping promises."

Occasion segmentation classifies buying behavior by important events such as birthdays, holidays, and weddings. Geographics involves segmenting a market by location. Psychographic segmentation is the division of a market on the basis of consumers' lifestyles and personalities. Demographic segmentation considers factors such as income, education, age, and gender."

        "A salesperson kept all appointments."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Sales are expected to increase by 5%. Spreadsheet software programs allow businesses to use a computer to perform accounting and other financial calculations. An advantage of using a spreadsheet program is that a business can make various assumptions about sales and find out quickly what effect they will have on its financial situation. For example, a business could change the level of sales by different percentages, such as 5% or 10%, to find out the effect that would have on net income. The spreadsheet program automatically does the calculations. Although keeping appointments might lead to sales, a salesperson would likely not use a spreadsheet program to track appointments. Mailing labels are generated with database programs. Database programs are also used to track customers' purchases."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It's difficult to determine the right mix of digital and human interactions. While many guests enjoy the privacy that digital interactions provide, others may desire a human and personal experience. These differences in guests' preferences make it very difficult for hotels to determine which type of service guests actually prefer in any given situation. Increased efficiency resulting from automated services is a benefit, not a challenge. Guests' attitudes toward automated services are usually favorable and are not a motivating factor in their hotel choice or how much they are willing to spend on a room."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Hotels can customize guest room preferences. A customer database allows hotels to gather guest information and preferences so they can personalize the guests' experiences. For example, if a customer purchases several soft drinks from room service, the hotel can store that information in a database and then prepare the room by stocking the mini fridge with the same soft drink upon the customer's return. While restaurants can use social media to receive feedback, they are not necessarily using a database to improve customer satisfaction when they do so. A variety of services can be integrated into one system, but this does not necessarily depend on a database; rather, it is due to hotel and restaurant management system software. Finally, while technology such as washable chips allows management to determine inventory remotely, this is also not an example of how databases help improve customer satisfaction."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The author of the site has reputable credentials. One way to know that a website is a good source of quality information is to look at the author's credentials. An author who has written about or studied the subject is an indicator that the website is reliable. Isaiah could use this site to find out reputable information about credit card options. An article that is 15 years old is likely too old to be reliable. A website with advertisements for credit card companies might be biased because it is being sponsored by the products it is supposedly reviewing. A .com URL is not necessarily an indicator of a quality website."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Automated. Room key cards are similar to credit cards. When the guest swipes their room key card at the point of sale (e.g., hotel restaurant), the computer chip that is embedded in the room key card transmits transaction data to the hotel's computer system, which adds the expense to the guest's folio or bill. The guest pays for their purchases during the checkout process. This software helps the resort accurately track its guests' buying behavior and increases hotel efficiency because it reduces paperwork by using a central bookkeeping system.

Businesses use the information they obtain from data mining to make different types of business decisions. For example, a business might want to increase its sales. The business might use data-mining techniques to determine and analyze which customers possess the highest buying potential.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Salesperson A. Businesses often maintain databases of information to determine which salesperson has the highest amount of sales during a period of time. The database helps the business analyze information because salespeople with the most orders or the highest average invoice are not necessarily the ones who have the highest amount of sales. In this situation, salesperson A has 125 orders that each average $215 for a total of $26,875 ($215 x 125 = $26,875). Although salesperson B and salesperson D each have more orders, the average invoice is less, which results in less sales ($26,832 for salesperson B and $26,797 for salesperson D). Salesperson C has a higher average invoice amount but fewer orders for a total of $26,378."

      "explanation": "Descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data. Examples of descriptive statistics are mean (the simple mathematical average of a set of numbers), median (the middle number in a sorted list of numbers), and mode (the number occurring most frequently in a set). By analyzing descriptive statistics, marketing and other business managers can see the current state of affairs within the company as well as past performance. Predictive statistics, on the other hand, are used to help forecast future probabilities and trends based on historical data. Researchers use various modeling and statistical techniques to achieve this goal. In this example, Roger is analyzing descriptive statistics, not predictive statistics to aid his decision-making. He is not coding data or studying customer feedback."

The companies are familiar with many of the local tour and transportation services at the ports of call, and not all of them meet the standards of service and ethical responsibility that the cruise line or traveler expects. Therefore, tourists should use tour companies that are approved or recommended by the cruise line. This recommendation also applies to any transportation service (e.g., bus or taxi). Valuables, such as jewelry, should be locked in a safe on the ship to reduce the chance of theft onboard the ship or while on shore.

To operate, a business orders office supplies, outsources services (e.g., legal advice), leases equipment, etc. Its vendors send the business bills (invoices) that state how much the business owes. The business monitors and tracks the invoices to make sure it is billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect tax amount) on a bill, the business will likely contact the vendor to make necessary adjustments. Tracking invoices is one way the business controls its expenses. Accounts receivable are the monies coming into the business.

By performing a thorough self-assessment, you can identify potential occupations that you may enjoy. Researching every career you are familiar with would be time-consuming and overwhelming. Instead, you should focus on learning about a few select occupations that match your personality and abilities. Shadowing someone at work can help you determine if a potential occupation is right for you, but you should perform a self-assessment first to determine whom to shadow. Similarly, applying for an internship or apprenticeship is helpful only after you've narrowed down the career fields that you are interested in."

You should avoid the use of humor in application letters since you are writing about an important, serious topic. Educational achievements should be stressed in relation to the job opening if you have little or no work experience to discuss.

      "explanation": "Low profit margin. Pricing affects promotion decisions in a number of different ways. For instance, products with very low profit margins are usually promoted in lower-priced media. In other words, companies that have low profit margins and/or small promotional budgets often promote themselves largely on social media, which usually costs very little. The opposite would be true for a product with a high profit margin. Products that have high profit margins are usually promoted in a combination of media, including radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines.

      "explanation": "No, it can delay entry into the full market. Test marketing involves introducing a product to a limited market to see what its acceptance will be. Test marketing serves to guide the planning of actual marketing strategies. The product may be tried out in specific locations to get customers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 reactions before starting a wider distribution. However, not all new products need test marketing. Test marketing may not be used for some products/services because it is costly, delays entry into the full market, provides no guarantee of actual success, may not give an accurate picture of performance, and gives competitors an opportunity to steal the idea while it is being tested."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Product cannibalization. Businesses watch and adjust their product lines to meet customers' changing needs and wants, which helps them compete effectively in the marketplace and generate profits. A business might decide to remove a product from its product mix to avoid or eliminate cannibalization, which occurs when the sale of one of a company's products takes away sales from another product. In short, the business will give up one product to extend the life cycle of another product. Alteration is a product-mix strategy that involves making changes to the company's products or lines. Alteration may involve completely redesigning a product or changing things such as color, style, or packaging. Substitution involves using a similar product in place of another good or service. A business might substitute one or a few products, but it is unlikely to substitute items for its entire inventory. Inventory shrinkage involves inventory losses due to shoplifting, employee theft, breakage, misplaced goods, or poor record keeping."

      "explanation": "New products are easier to introduce. Products are easier to introduce under an accepted, recognized brand name. One of the reasons this is true is that family brands are tied to company image. Family brands are used for related products, not unrelated products. The amount of shelf space needed depends on the number of items in the product line. Sellers are generally more willing to provide additional shelf space for an addition to a successful family brand."

      "explanation": "Are cheaper and safer than introducing new products. A product extension, or line extension, uses an existing brand to introduce a new and related product in the same product category, often to satisfy previously unmet needs in that market. Because product extensions can rely on the reputation of the parent brand, they are often less expensive and less risky than introducing a completely new product. Brand extensions allow businesses to compete in different product categories. Product extensions have no bearing on manufacturing speed. Product extensions build off of, but do not replace, products already on the market."

An effective corporate brand uses a variety of tools that creates and reinforces certain impressions and images of the business in the minds of the consumers, which involves communicating the company's benefits. For example, an entertainment business's brand is likely to communicate the idea or image of \"fun\" as a benefit to consumers. Successful brands do not communicate motives in a vague way.

When selecting vendors and suppliers, companies should make sure that the vendor they choose will be able to fulfill the company's needs in a timely manner so that delays and other production issues can be avoided. It is unnecessary for a vendor to agree with the company's stance on political issues, and politics should not be a reason for choosing one vendor over another. It would be inappropriate and unethical to select a vendor simply because the vendor was willing to cooperate in unethical business practices. A vendor's ability to participate in the company's annual volunteer event should not affect a vendor's quality as a potential business partner."

Establishing relationships with fellow salespeople is beneficial, but not necessary to make sales.

In selling, customer service is where the real competition among businesses begins. For example, imagine you're a salesperson for a company that manufactures tires to sell to automakers. The tires you make aren't much different than the tires your clients could get from any other company, and the prices are similar, too. That's when customer service becomes key. Are you available when your clients need you? Are you willing to help them when they need to change orders? Can you help your customers if there's a problem with their shipments? These are the actions that will separate your company from the rest of the pack. Promotions, online reviews, and product longevity may help your product sell, but customer service is where the competition among businesses truly begins."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "$85.06. Many restaurants offer special prices on certain types of dinners to attract customers. Customers order those dinners because they are priced lower than usual. If customers also have coupons for discounts, the restaurant calculates the discount to determine the total cost. In this example, the restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 X 2 = $45.98; $45.98 X 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90). Then, subtract the discount from the cost of the two dinners ($45.98 - $6.90 = $39.08). Add the discounted price of the two dinners to the regular price of the other two dinners to calculate the total cost for the table ($39.08 + $22.99 + $22.99 = $85.06)."

Companies generally don't refuse to implement new tools because most companies understand the value of new technology. The possibility for increased productivity and efficiency is a benefit of using channel management technology, not a barrier to it. Employees are generally able and willing to learn to master new technologies."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Coercion. Coercion is an attempt to gain compliance through threats or by bullying. When a channel leader places unreasonable pressure on a channel member to do something that is not in the best interest of the channel member, it is using coercion. For example, a channel leader that yields a lot of power in the distribution chain may set unrealistic sales goals for a dealer, or it may pressure a supplier to lower its prices to a point that it hurts the supplier's profits. Coercion tends to create channel conflict, leads to unfair and unsatisfactory business relationships, and often disrupts the distribution process. Control is a management function that monitors the work effort. Deception is misleading behavior. Diplomacy is tact."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Authority to demand cooperation. Strong leaders have the authority and power to influence others and direct the actions of others. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid conflict within the channel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for the leader to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to accomplish their individual tasks. When each member is cooperating and working for the good of the channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not necessary for the leader to develop friendships. Channel leaders usually do not provide training. It is not possible to regulate change, although an effective leader will help channel members adjust to change."

      "explanation": "A credit card company offers cards with sports teams' logos. Affinity marketing is a strategy in which an organization solicits responses from a group that shares a common interest or activity. If a credit card has a sports team's logo on it, fans of that team might be more likely to choose that particular company. An airline that offers frequent flyer miles is not an affinity partnership because there is no relationship between the airline and another organization; rather, this is an example of frequency marketing. A restaurant giving discounts to members of its rewards program is also an example of a frequency marketing strategy. Finally, a bank that pays to have its name on a local concert venue is engaged in a sponsorship, rather than an affinity partnership."

Speakers should show visual aids to enhance their message when those charts, graphics, videos, etc., correspond with the specific information that they are presenting. It's not likely that an image will be relevant or appropriate for the entire presentation, and overuse may cause it to lose its impact. A visual aid might help engage a bored audience but would add little value if it isn't related to the material being shared.

      "explanation": "The government pays workers based on quantity rather than quality. In a communist command economy, most resources are allocated toward industrial goods rather than consumer goods. The few consumer goods that are available are often poor quality because the government pays workers based on the quantity, not the quality, of what they produce. People in communist command economies need consumer goods as much as those in other economic systems do. High taxes do not necessarily have a direct effect on production of consumer goods. Finally, people in a communist command economy do not consume everything that they produce; this is instead a characteristic of a traditional economy."

      "explanation": "Use a price deflator. Inflation can distort GDP by making it higher, not because production has increased, but because prices are higher. A price deflator is an economic metric that converts prices to a base dollar value and allows GDP to be accurately compared over time. Double counting occurs when production is counted more than once. It is not related to inflation. The balance of trade is the difference between imports and exports. It does not relate to the effects of inflation on GDP. Nominal GDP is GDP that has not been adjusted to account for the effects of inflation. GDP that has been adjusted to account for inflation is called real GDP."

The law of diminishing returns is an economic concept that states that if one input increases while others are constant, at some point the increases in output will decline. In this example, Kelly added six new employees to her business without changing anything else. Kelly's business reached the point at which output could no longer increase unless the inputs also increased. This example demonstrates the law of diminishing returns, not the need for effective employee training, the harm of taking business risks, or the danger of hiring employees."

        "Economic recession",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Tight money supply. Many factors affect interest rates, including business cycles, consumer spending, inflation, and the money supply. If the money supply is low or tight, there is less money available to lend. This causes interest rates to increase. The government might implement policies to tighten the money supply when the rate of inflation rapidly increases. When investment spending increases, the money supply is usually loose, so interest rates are lower\u2014it is cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow money. During a recession, businesses are not expanding, unemployment increases, and consumer spending decreases. Because a recession negatively affects the economy, the government may implement policies that lower interest rates to stimulate commercial growth and consumer spending."

Feedback does not necessarily reinforce your own opinions, as others may have a different view of you than you have of yourself.

Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from high to low. Feeling that you could do a job you have read about would indicate your level of self-esteem is high. Imagining how you would feel if you had already graduated is an example of visualization that can be used to support self-esteem.

It includes information about past situations and what is happening now. By obtaining and using marketing information, business managers can predict the risks that might occur in the future and take steps to control those risks. For example, if current marketing information indicates that one product is losing popularity, a business can modify the product or repackage it to be more appealing. As a result, the business might avoid losing customers, which is a future risk. Managers often use marketing information to prepare documents and reports, but that is not an advantage of obtaining and using the information. Business managers do not obtain and use marketing information to train and direct employees, or to review and understand regulations."

If employees fully understand their customers' complaints, they will be better able to solve the problem. Employees should express empathy, but they should not take customers' complaints as personal attacks against them. It is not always possible to give customers whatever they want to make them happy.

SUGGING is an acronym for \"selling under the guise of research.\" SUGGING is an unethical practice in which a marketer pretends to conduct research but, in fact, is really attempting to sell a good or service to a consumer. SUGGING is deceptive and rarely facilitates a long-term selling relationship. It also harms the integrity of the general marketing-research field because potential respondents who have been subjected to SUGGING are less likely to trust researchers and are likely to question their true motives. A telemarketer who asks a person if they know anyone who might buy a certain product is trying to obtain a referral. Sending samples to consumers is a promotional technique. A salesperson providing a customer the opportunity to try a product for a certain period of time is implementing a strategy to make a sale."

Follow-up letters also remind the interviewer of the specific applicant and help create a favorable impression. If there are several applicants with comparable qualifications, an interviewer might select the one who remembered to send a follow-up letter. An applicant's resume, references, and test scores usually are submitted with the employment application or during the employment interview."

Cover letters are intended to give employers a better sense of your unique skills and experiences and should be customized to each specific job.

These adjustments can be increases or decreases, depending on the circumstances faced by the business.

More competition exists in this kind of market than in any other. Most products are sold at market price\u2014the actual price that prevails in a market at any particular moment. The market price is controlled by supply and demand. In an oligopoly, competition is more likely to be based on style or brand than on price. In a monopoly, there is virtually no competition because there is only one seller or provider of a good or service. In a monopolistic competitive market, there is competition because there are many buyers and sellers offering different types of products at different prices. There is less competition in this kind of market than in a pure competitive market."

Businesses that agree to coordinate the discounts and credit terms that they offer their customers are guilty of fixing the price of those services. If all the competing businesses in one area agree to offer the same discounts and credit terms, the customers have no choice in selecting a business that offers a different price. In target pricing, prices are set to provide a certain rate of return on an investment. The decisions a business makes concerning which prices to charge is price planning.

Producers and sellers are protected by well-written warranties and guarantees because their responsibilities to the customer are clearly defined. Informing customers about how problems will be handled helps prevent purchasers from making unreasonable claims against producers or sellers. Decreasing consumer confidence is not a purpose of warranties and guarantees, but increasing it is. Decreasing feedback from customers and avoiding a customer-oriented focus are not purposes of warranties and guarantees; in fact, increasing them is a benefit a company receives from offering warranties and guarantees with its products."

It increases brand recognition, raises product awareness, and communicates product benefits. By delivering promotional messages in multiple ways, a business is more likely to reach its target market than it would be using one form of promotion alone. No one promotional mix element is the best. Many factors affect the selection of a promotional mix. Marketers know that a promotional mix that is appropriate for one business may be totally inappropriate for another. Likewise, a promotional mix that was successful for a company at one time may need to be changed to a new combination of elements; it should not always stay the same."

Placing corrective advertising is often a major financial cost to a company and may also negatively affect the company's reputation. The government may also require a company to cease running the deceptive ads and require the company to pay a fine. The government is not likely to imprison the company's CEO, and it does not have the jurisdiction to increase the company's sales-tax rate for the purpose of punishing the company's wrongdoing.

Selling-activity policies focus on providing salespeople with guidelines for interacting with customers or potential customers. They are basic directions that explain how salespeople should approach and deal with customers and how to best use their time. An installation policy would be considered a type of service policy. Service policies are designed to govern the support a company provides to customers after the sale."

A table of contents simply shows what is included in the site. It doesn't confirm the accuracy of the contents. A professional look to a website only confirms that the site is designed by a good designer. It does not guarantee that any of the content is accurate.

It is important to protect against identity theft to prevent unauthorized individuals from using your information to obtain credit in your name. In most cases, the unauthorized person has no intention of paying for the credit, so the debt will be listed on your credit report and may have a negative effect on your credit rating.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Credit. Credit is the arrangement by which businesses or individuals can purchase now and pay later. When businesses and individuals buy on credit, they pay interest on the amount of credit. If interest rates increase, businesses and individuals often stop buying on credit because it is too expensive. For example, if the interest rate is 4% and the amount of credit is $100, the cost of buying on credit is $4. However, if the interest rate increases to 15%, the cost of $100 credit is $15. Therefore, high interest rates usually cause businesses and consumers to hold off buying expensive items on credit. Fluctuations in interest rates do not have an impact on the use of tax incentives, discounts, or rebates."

      "explanation": "For the potential of a high return, you usually accept a high risk. The statement, \"For the potential of a high return, you usually accept a high risk,\" describes the relationship between risk and return. Higher risks usually bring higher returns. Lower risks usually bring lower returns. Every investment has some risk\u2014none are risk free. It would be unwise to take a high risk for something that might bring a low return.

      "explanation": "Apply their talents where they are best used. People who use their talents are more likely to succeed in their careers. To know what their talents are, individuals must determine their personal strengths and weaknesses. For example, a very artistic person is probably going to be happier and more successful as a graphic artist than if they were to work as an accountant, which involves working with a lot of numerical data. While it is important for people to try to improve weaknesses (e.g., procrastination), this does not mean that they change their personalities. Improving relationships with friends is a personal goal rather than one that will help a person succeed in their career. Everyone experiences conflict at some time, and it cannot be eliminated."

      "explanation": "A veterinarian invents and sells a device to prevent horse water troughs from freezing. Creating a product to solve a problem and selling that product is a good example of an entrepreneurial venture because a need has been identified and met; the product solves a problem for consumers, while the resulting sales benefit the veterinarian. A juice bar selling juice on location during special events expands its business but does not represent a new idea or problem solved. A pumpkin farm offering pumpkin carving and costume contests to create more interest is not creating something new or solving a problem.

Savings accounts are insured by the FDIC, so they're extremely safe. A certificate of deposit (CD) is a lending investment in which you lend money to a bank at a set interest rate for a particular period of time. With CDs, you are guaranteed a certain rate of return, but you can't access your money before the end of the time period without paying a penalty.

      "explanation": "The convenience of buying now and paying later. Credit cards offer many advantages, including the convenience of buying needed items now and paying later. Other advantages of credit include the security of not needing to carry cash, fraud protection, and in some cases rewards for making purchases. Having a credit card does not mean that you have the ability to spend unlimited money. Most credit cards have credit limits that determine the maximum amount of money you are able to spend each credit period. Most credit cards also have high interest charges on unpaid credit balances. When you fail to pay off your credit card balance, your credit score is lowered\u2014making it more difficult for you to receive loans."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Fixed-rate. A fixed-rate mortgage offers the benefit of guaranteeing that the interest rate and monthly payment for the mortgage loan will stay the same for the full term of the loan. The interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage is subject to change at certain intervals based on changes in the interest rate market. Therefore, an adjustable-rate mortgage does not have a guaranteed interest rate and the monthly payment for this kind of mortgage loan will shift and change over time. Both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are often available in 15- or 30-year terms, so the span of the loan will not necessarily determine whether the interest rate or monthly payment will stay the same."

In some situations, money is invested or placed in an account that generates more value. Money also serves as a medium of exchange. This occurs when money is used to obtain goods and services. Bartering involves trading one good or service for another good or service. Money also functions as a measure of value.

The main difference between a salaried employee and an hourly employee is that a salaried person is paid a fixed amount of money per pay period, whereas a wage earner is paid by the hour. In this example, Joel is a salaried employee because he gets paid the same amount each month regardless of how many hours he works. Anna, on the other hand, is a wage earner because she is paid by the hour. Earning interest is a different way to make money that involves investing your money over time. Earning dividends requires buying shares in a company. A dividend is a sum of money paid regularly by a company to its shareholders out of its profits."

A basic illustration of the time value of money is money and the interest it earns in a savings account. Principal is the deposited amount, which is not modified. Opportunity cost is what you have to give up when you make a choice. In this case, the opportunity cost of depositing $100 is spending it on something else.

      "explanation": "Immediate gratification. Opportunity cost is the benefit that is lost when a person decides to use scarce resources for one purpose rather than another. When a person places $500 in the bank, the opportunity (benefit) is having money available for the future. The cost of placing money in the bank means that the person does not have the money to purchase a desired item. When a person purchases something that they don't need but really want, the benefit to the person is immediate gratification or a sense of instant satisfaction that they have acquired the desired product. The opportunity cost (benefit lost) is not a higher discretionary income, lower salary or wages, or long-term dissatisfaction."

Spending less money on clothing isn't a measurable goal because it's too vague\u2014\"less\" is more difficult to measure than a specific dollar amount. \"I'd like to pay off some of my credit card debt soon\" is also not a measurable goal\u2014there is no specific money or time element. \"I'm thinking of buying a house\" isn't a measurable goal because it isn't specific enough\u2014 houses can cost different amounts of money, so it's hard to measure unless you have a certain dollar amount in mind."

Instead of spending money at a coffee shop every morning, for example, you could make coffee at home and put the money into a savings account or retirement fund. Avoiding risks in your career will not necessarily offset the effects of unexpected setbacks.

It is important to build good credit because lending institutions look at a person's credit history to determine if they should receive a loan. When an individual has a poor credit history, they may not be able to obtain large loans to buy a car or house or to start a new business. Responsible credit involves striving to maintain a high credit rating, looking for the lowest interest rates possible, and limiting the number of credit cards they use.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Total costs. Many banks and credit card companies offer many different credit cards. To use credit wisely, it is important to compare the various offers of credit to determine the total costs. All credit cards charge an annual percentage rate on the unpaid balance, and some offer a low rate for a short period of time to attract new customers. Some credit cards also charge an annual fee. Then, there are fees for late payment and cash advances. It is necessary to compare the costs to determine the best offer rather than accept a credit card that has a high interest rate, a high annual fee, and high fees for penalties. The wise use of credit does not involve comparing the various offers of credit to determine the affiliated banks or company sponsors. Credit card fees and costs are not taxes."

      "explanation": "Credit cards allow you to spend money that you might not have. Credit cards are actually a form of a loan\u2014the company loans money and then gets it back by charging interest and other fees. Therefore, you can make purchases on your credit card even when you do not have the same amount of money in the bank. This is not a wise use of credit, however. While many credit card companies allow you to pay only a portion of your credit balance, this is not a good idea because you will be charged interest on the remaining balance. Credit cards do have many benefits, such as offering rewards, giving you the ability to make large purchases, and building a good credit score. You need a good credit history whether or not you have a credit card because credit history is often used when applying to rent an apartment or buying a car."

      "explanation": "Use the credit card to pay for routine expenses and pay the balance in full each month. By paying a credit card in full each month, the cardholder can establish a positive credit history and avoid the extra cost of interest. Charging a large amount to the card and making minimum payments would cause interest to accrue on the account and put the cardholder at risk of developing poor credit. Since student loans are not typically charged interest until graduation, it is not beneficial to transfer that debt to a credit card that would begin charging interest right away."

A credit agency is a business that maintains files of credit information on individuals and businesses. It is important to make sure that credit agencies have accurate information about your credit history because other businesses purchase the reports to make decisions about extending credit to you or providing a loan to you. Although people can provide information to improve their credit ratings, it is the credit agencies that change or update the information. Good credit reports can increase the chances of obtaining a bank loan, but reviewing the reports cannot ensure that people obtain bank loans.

Also, if there was a history of late payments for a certain account, individuals might want to explain that the charges were in dispute and that the matter has been resolved.

First of all, information in your credit report can impact whether you get a loan as well as how much you pay to borrow money. Secondly, you should review your credit report annually to ensure that information that appears in the report is correct, complete, and current. Thirdly, by reviewing your credit report, you can ensure that you are not the victim of identity theft.

      "explanation": "Arrange for the post office to hold your mail while you're out of town on vacation. People tend to associate identity theft with computer hacking; however, thieves often use very simple methods to steal others' personal and financial information. One of the easiest ways to steal confidential or personal information is by simply taking a person's mail from their mailbox. Rather than waiting to pick up your mail until your mailbox is full, you should get your mail from your mailbox on a daily basis. If you know that you are not going to be home to get your mail because you will be away for an extended period of time, such as on vacation, you should make arrangements for the post office to hold your mail while you're gone. Including your return address on all of your outgoing mail is a wise practice, but doing so won't necessarily prevent mail identity theft. Applying for as many credit cards as possible is likely to increase your chances of falling victim to mail identity theft, not lower it."

Stocks, mutual funds, real estate, and collectibles are moderate- and high-risk ownership investments that provide opportunities for return by letting you own something of significance. A stock is a piece of paper\u2014 whether real or virtual\u2014that says you own part of a corporation. As an owner (or shareholder), you have the rights and responsibilities of ownership. You may be able to sell your stocks for a profit, making a sizeable sum of money. But, being an owner means you risk losing money, too, if the corporation suffers financially or goes out of business. Bonds, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit are lending investments. With a lending investment, you allow someone to borrow your money for a period of time\u2014for a price.

The benefit to shareholders of placing money in mutual funds is that a well-trained fund manager has the expertise to make smart investment decisions on their behalf. Shareholders are not guaranteed a minimal amount of return on their mutual-fund investments, but because the funds are spread out among different securities, the risk of a total financial loss is reduced.
