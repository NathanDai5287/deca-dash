Obtaining credit in your name. Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains another person's information
and uses that information to assume the other person's identity. It is important to protect against identity theft to
prevent unauthorized individuals from using your information to obtain credit in your name. In most cases, the
unauthorized person has no intention of paying for the credit, so the debt will be listed on your credit report and
may have a negative effect on your credit rating. It is not important to protect against identity theft to prevent
unauthorized individuals from sending you information online or trying to sell you a product.

Credit. Credit is the arrangement by which businesses or individuals can purchase now and pay later. When
businesses and individuals buy on credit, they pay interest on the amount of credit. If interest rates increase,
businesses and individuals often stop buying on credit because it is too expensive. For example, if the interest
rate is 4% and the amount of credit is $100, the cost of buying on credit is $4. However, if the interest rate
increases to 15%, the cost of $100 credit is $15. Therefore, high interest rates usually cause businesses and
consumers to hold off buying expensive items on credit. Fluctuations in interest rates do not have an impact on
the use of tax incentives, discounts, or rebates.

For the potential of a high return, you usually accept a high risk. The statement, "For the potential of a high
return, you usually accept a high risk," describes the relationship between risk and return. Higher risks usually
bring higher returns. Lower risks usually bring lower returns. Every investment has some risk—none are risk
free. It would be unwise to take a high risk for something that might bring a low return. It is nearly impossible to
find a high-return investment that requires only a low risk.

Apply their talents where they are best used. People who use their talents are more likely to succeed in their
careers. To know what their talents are, individuals must determine their personal strengths and weaknesses.
For example, a very artistic person is probably going to be happier and more successful as a graphic artist than
if they were to work as an accountant, which involves working with a lot of numerical data. While it is important
for people to try to improve weaknesses (e.g., procrastination), this does not mean that they change their
personalities. Improving relationships with friends is a personal goal rather than one that will help a person
succeed in their career. Everyone experiences conflict at some time, and it cannot be eliminated.

A veterinarian invents and sells a device to prevent horse water troughs from freezing. Creating a product to
solve a problem and selling that product is a good example of an entrepreneurial venture because a need has
been identified and met; the product solves a problem for consumers, while the resulting sales benefit the
veterinarian. A juice bar selling juice on location during special events expands its business but does not
represent a new idea or problem solved. A pumpkin farm offering pumpkin carving and costume contests to
create more interest is not creating something new or solving a problem. A “cretzel” might be a new creative

The convenience of buying now and paying later. Credit cards offer many advantages, including the
convenience of buying needed items now and paying later. Other advantages of credit include the security of
not needing to carry cash, fraud protection, and in some cases rewards for making purchases. Having a credit
card does not mean that you have the ability to spend unlimited money. Most credit cards have credit limits that
determine the maximum amount of money you are able to spend each credit period. Most credit cards also
have high interest charges on unpaid credit balances. When you fail to pay off your credit card balance, your
credit score is lowered—making it more difficult for you to receive loans.

Fixed-rate. A fixed-rate mortgage offers the benefit of guaranteeing that the interest rate and monthly payment
for the mortgage loan will stay the same for the full term of the loan. The interest rate on an adjustable-rate
mortgage is subject to change at certain intervals based on changes in the interest rate market. Therefore, an
adjustable-rate mortgage does not have a guaranteed interest rate and the monthly payment for this kind of
mortgage loan will shift and change over time. Both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are often available
in 15- or 30-year terms, so the span of the loan will not necessarily determine whether the interest rate or
monthly payment will stay the same.

Store of value. Money functions as a store of value when it is saved rather than spent. The money can be held
over time, and it retains value for future purchasing power. In some situations, money is invested or placed in
an account that generates more value. Money also serves as a medium of exchange. This occurs when money
is used to obtain goods and services. Bartering involves trading one good or service for another good or
service. Money also functions as a measure of value. When money functions as a measure of value, the
individual holding the money assesses what they are willing to pay for a good or service, thereby
communicating the product's value or worth.

A salary; wages. The main difference between a salaried employee and an hourly employee is that a salaried
person is paid a fixed amount of money per pay period, whereas a wage earner is paid by the hour. In this
example, Joel is a salaried employee because he gets paid the same amount each month regardless of how
many hours he works. Anna, on the other hand, is a wage earner because she is paid by the hour. Earning
interest is a different way to make money that involves investing your money over time. Earning dividends
requires buying shares in a company. A dividend is a sum of money paid regularly by a company to its
shareholders out of its profits.

The time value of money. The term "time value of money" refers to the increase of an amount of money as a

earns in a savings account. Principal is the deposited amount, which is not modified. Opportunity cost is what
you have to give up when you make a choice. In this case, the opportunity cost of depositing $100 is spending it
on something else. Inflation has a negative impact on the time value of money.

Immediate gratification. Opportunity cost is the benefit that is lost when a person decides to use scarce
resources for one purpose rather than another. When a person places $500 in the bank, the opportunity
(benefit) is having money available for the future. The cost of placing money in the bank means that the person
does not have the money to purchase a desired item. When a person purchases something that they don't need
but really want, the benefit to the person is immediate gratification or a sense of instant satisfaction that they
have acquired the desired product. The opportunity cost (benefit lost) is not a higher discretionary income, lower
salary or wages, or long-term dissatisfaction.

I want to save $3,000 for a new truck. Measurable goals can be counted or assessed in a way that shows real
progress. If you want to save $3,000 for a new truck, this is a measurable goal because you can track the
amount of money you save and determine whether or not you're successful. Spending less money on clothing
isn't a measurable goal because it's too vague—"less" is more difficult to measure than a specific dollar amount.
"I'd like to pay off some of my credit card debt soon" is also not a measurable goal—there is no specific money
or time element. "I'm thinking of buying a house" isn't a measurable goal because it isn't specific enough—
 houses can cost different amounts of money, so it's hard to measure unless you have a certain dollar amount in
mind.

Financial goals cannot be realistically set until a personal budget has been established. Without creating a
personal budget of income and expenses first, it would be impossible to set realistic financial goals. Wealthy
people may have a great deal of income, but they still have expenses and future financial goals they would like
to accomplish. If goals are set too high, it may be difficult to achieve them; it is more advisable to set realistic
short-term and long-term goals. Reducing or paying down debt should be part of a budget, but it is not
necessary to eliminate it entirely before deciding on other financial goals.

Reduce any unnecessary expenses. A good way to prepare for unexpected setbacks is to save as much as
possible by reducing unnecessary expenses. Instead of spending money at a coffee shop every morning, for
example, you could make coffee at home and put the money into a savings account or retirement fund.
Avoiding risks in your career will not necessarily offset the effects of unexpected setbacks. Refinancing your

Paying credit card balances on time. Credit allows a person to purchase now and pay later. Building a good
credit history involves using credit responsibly, which includes making credit card payments on time. It is
important to build good credit because lending institutions look at a person's credit history to determine if they
should receive a loan. When an individual has a poor credit history, they may not be able to obtain large loans
to buy a car or house or to start a new business. Responsible credit involves striving to maintain a high credit
rating, looking for the lowest interest rates possible, and limiting the number of credit cards they use. Although it
is a good idea to seek counseling to reduce unmanageable debt, this action is taken when a person has not
used credit responsibly.

Total costs. Many banks and credit card companies offer many different credit cards. To use credit wisely, it is
important to compare the various offers of credit to determine the total costs. All credit cards charge an annual
percentage rate on the unpaid balance, and some offer a low rate for a short period of time to attract new
customers. Some credit cards also charge an annual fee. Then, there are fees for late payment and cash
advances. It is necessary to compare the costs to determine the best offer rather than accept a credit card that
has a high interest rate, a high annual fee, and high fees for penalties. The wise use of credit does not involve
comparing the various offers of credit to determine the affiliated banks or company sponsors. Credit card fees

Credit cards allow you to spend money that you might not have. Credit cards are actually a form of a loan—the
company loans money and then gets it back by charging interest and other fees. Therefore, you can make
purchases on your credit card even when you do not have the same amount of money in the bank. This is not a
wise use of credit, however. While many credit card companies allow you to pay only a portion of your credit
balance, this is not a good idea because you will be charged interest on the remaining balance. Credit cards do
have many benefits, such as offering rewards, giving you the ability to make large purchases, and building a
good credit score. You need a good credit history whether or not you have a credit card because credit history

information about your credit history because other businesses purchase the reports to make decisions about
extending credit to you or providing a loan to you. Although people can provide information to improve their

Shred or tear up important financial documents. To prevent identity thieves from getting your personal
information, you should always shred or tear up important financial documents before you dispose of them.
These documents might include credit card statements, credit offers, expired credit cards, bank statements, etc.
You should review your credit report at least once a year (not every five years) to verify your accounts and
account balances. While paying the entire balance on your credit cards monthly and insisting on a fixed-rate
loan when borrowing money are wise financial decisions, they do not necessarily prevent identity thieves from
getting your personal information.

Arrange for the post office to hold your mail while you're out of town on vacation. People tend to associate
identity theft with computer hacking; however, thieves often use very simple methods to steal others' personal
and financial information. One of the easiest ways to steal confidential or personal information is by simply
taking a person's mail from their mailbox. Rather than waiting to pick up your mail until your mailbox is full, you
should get your mail from your mailbox on a daily basis. If you know that you are not going to be home to get
your mail because you will be away for an extended period of time, such as on vacation, you should make
arrangements for the post office to hold your mail while you're gone. Including your return address on all of your
outgoing mail is a wise practice, but doing so won't necessarily prevent mail identity theft. Applying for as many
credit cards as possible is likely to increase your chances of falling victim to mail identity theft, not lower it.

Call the bank and check that the email is legitimate. An email that appears to be from a financial institution that

request is legitimate, as well as providing the information in a verifiable and secure way. Providing the
information without verifying the legitimacy of the request could make Amelia a victim of identity theft. Switching
to a different bank might not be necessary. Replying to the email could also put Amelia at risk of identity theft.

Create passwords that are hard to guess. One of the most effective ways to protect yourself against online
identity theft is by creating strong passwords. Passwords should ideally contain numbers, special symbols, and
a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. Words that can be easily associated with you should be
avoided. Hackers and other online criminals are often able to guess weak passwords. It's also a good idea to
use private Wi-Fi networks whenever possible, since public networks carry additional risks. If you do use public
networks, it's a good idea to install firewalls and virus-detection software on your devices. You should review
your credit report once a year to check for signs of identity theft—not once every three years.

Stocks. Stocks, mutual funds, real estate, and collectibles are moderate- and high-risk ownership investments
that provide opportunities for return by letting you own something of significance. A stock is a piece of paper—
 whether real or virtual—that says you own part of a corporation. As an owner (or shareholder), you have the
rights and responsibilities of ownership. You may be able to sell your stocks for a profit, making a sizeable sum
of money. But, being an owner means you risk losing money, too, if the corporation suffers financially or goes
out of business. Bonds, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit are lending investments. With a lending
investment, you allow someone to borrow your money for a period of time—for a price. The extra money you
receive provides the motivation for lending. Investors who can't handle much risk put their money into lending
investments. Since Logan is willing to accept a moderate or high risk in exchange for the potential of a
moderate or high return, he should invest in stocks.

Investors have access to a fund manager's expertise. A mutual fund is a type of ownership investment that
involves collecting money from many people and then investing it in an assortment of different securities such
as stocks or bonds. The benefit to shareholders of placing money in mutual funds is that a well-trained fund
manager has the expertise to make smart investment decisions on their behalf. Shareholders are not
guaranteed a minimal amount of return on their mutual-fund investments, but because the funds are spread out
among different securities, the risk of a total financial loss is reduced. Disadvantages to investing in mutual
funds are that shareholders pay fees for someone to manage their investments, and the mutual-fund earnings
are taxable.

Installment credit account. This type of credit is used to purchase large, expensive items such as furniture or

Revolving credit usually has a credit limit, and there is no set time for payment in full. Secured loans are funds
obtained when the borrower pledges to the lender some valuable possession, such as real estate, stocks and
bonds, machinery, or the cash value of a life insurance policy. Unsecured loans are funds obtained by simply
signing a promissory note to repay the loan. These loans are usually for a short period of time.

Bonds. Bonds are interest-bearing lending investments issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations.
Investors lend money to bond issuers with the expectation that they will earn a set rate of interest for a specified
time period—such as a year, 10 years, or longer. In this way, a bond is similar to a certificate of deposit (CD).
With a bond, however, you don't pay a penalty if you withdraw the invested amount before the end of the time
frame. Nelson's grandparents sent him bonds, not interest, checks, or stocks. Interest is the reward or cost of
lending or borrowing money, usually figured as a percentage of the amount. Checks are written documents that
contain an order for a bank to pay a specific amount of money to a payee. Stocks are shares or units of
ownership in a corporation.

Savings account. A savings account, which is an investment in which an individual lends money to a bank to
earn interest, involves very little risk. The money is easily accessible, and there are few restrictions as to how a
person can use their money. Stocks are shares or units of ownership in a corporation. Stocks fluctuate over
time and involve more risk. A mutual fund is a pool of shareholders' money invested by professional managers
in an assortment of different securities. Investing in an assortment of different securities reduces risk, but
accessing money in a mutual fund takes time. Real estate is an ownership investment in which individuals
purchase property such as buildings and land. Real estate is not a liquid asset, meaning it is difficult to access

$18,381.60. The formula for calculating interest is Principal X Rate X Time. To determine how much an
investment will be worth at some time in the future, first determine the interest earned per year by multiplying
the original investment by the interest rate ($10,212 X .08 = $816.96). Then, multiply the interest earned per
year by the number of years to determine the total interest earned over the life of the investment ($816.96 X 10
= $8,169.60). To determine how much the total investment will be worth, add the total interest earned to the
original investment ($8,169.60 + $10,212 = $18,381.60).

Minimize, risk. Insurance companies sell insurance policies. An insurance policy is a contract that states that
the insurer (the insurance company) will pay for specified losses incurred by an individual or another company
(policy holder) in return for installment payments (premiums). The purpose of purchasing insurance policies
(e.g., life, property, professional liability, etc.) is to protect the policyholder's assets and minimize financial
losses associated with various risks (e.g., death, fire, and malpractice). By minimizing the policyholder's
financial losses, the insurance company is providing a product that protects the policyholder's assets. Many
insurance companies now provide financial products (e.g., investments), which are designed to build wealth.
The primary purpose of insurance companies is not to provide insurance products that increase the
policyholder's profitability but to protect the policyholder from financial losses.

To reduce risk. Certain investments are safer than others and pay a steady return. However, investments that
have more risk usually pay a higher return. To reduce the overall level of risk, investors often diversify and
purchase a variety of products. For example, they might invest in government bonds that pay a guaranteed
amount even though that amount is not particularly high. Then, they might buy stock in major corporations that
have a history of paying reasonable dividends. Finally, they might invest in startup companies that could
potentially pay a high return. By diversifying, investors reduce the possibility of losing the entire investment. The
purpose of using diversification strategies is not to decrease equity, control debt, or manage price.

$20.44. Credit card companies using the adjusted balance method charge interest only on the principal balance
that remains each month. To calculate how much total interest Deacon will pay during the initial three billing
periods, first calculate the monthly interest rate by dividing the APR by the number of months in a year (0.20 /
12 = .0167). Then, multiply the monthly interest rate by the principal amount to determine the amount of interest
charged for the first month (0.0167 X $600 = $10.00). For the following month, you first need to determine the
new principal amount. Subtract the interest amount charged during the initial month from last month's
repayment to determine the payment amount applied to the principal ($200 - $10 = $190). Next, subtract the
payment amount applied to the principal amount at the end of the first month from the original balance to
determine the new principal amount to be charged interest for the second month ($600 - $190 = $410). Repeat
these steps for any subsequent months (Month 2: 0.0167 X $410 = $6.83; $200 - $6.83 = $193.17; $410 -
$193.17 = $216.83; Month 3: 0.0167 X $216.83 = $3.61). Add together the interest paid each month to
determine the total interest Deacon will pay during the initial three billing periods ($10 + $6.83 + $3.61 =
$20.44).

explain the jobs to others. They can provide details about what the jobs actually entail and describe an average
workday. Employees in specific fields might not have information about referral programs, placement services,
or industry statistics.

Employment outlook. Governments often post information on their websites about employment and occupation
trends. For example, the U.S. government posts the Occupational Outlook Handbook online, which provides
information about employment trends in the United States. This information includes general job responsibilities,
salary ranges, number of workers currently working in a particular field, employment outlook, etc. The Canadian
government also posts employment trends in Canada (Job Futures). Individuals set their own career goals,
which are not included on career-related government websites. Programming needs and testing tips are not
included on career-related government websites.

Occupational handbooks and other online career resources. Libraries offer a wealth of information regarding
career opportunities. Job seekers can visit a local library to access the internet, where job boards, career
preparation websites, and other online resources can be utilized. Libraries often have access to specialized
databases for research that may also aid in the job search. Finally, libraries generally have a variety of printed
materials (books, trade magazines, etc.) that can help job seekers learn more about career opportunities.
Personal contacts, guidance counselors, and on-the-job training and career preparation are also valuable tools
for job seekers, but they are not usually provided by general libraries.

What are my favorite classes in school? When determining what occupation you might want to pursue, you
need to assess your interests and skills. Your favorite classes in school can help you determine the subjects
that interest you. For example, if you like to do math and you do well in your accounting class, you might
consider a career in accounting or finance. Or, if you enjoy writing and do well in your composition class, you
might consider a career as a journalist, editor, or copywriter. The types of sports that you like, the computer
programs that you currently work with, and the grade that you received on your last science exam are not
questions that will help you determine your occupational interest.

Job shadow at a financial institution. Job shadowing at a financial institution would give Jen the opportunity to
learn about the job requirements and skills needed for a job in finance. She would also have the opportunity to
ask a professional questions. A career assessment test is helpful when trying to identify interests but does not
provide much information about a specific career. A job as a store cashier would not expose her to high-level
finance career options. Applying for college scholarships would not provide any information about finance
careers.

Performing volunteer work. Volunteer work refers to activities or tasks that a person performs without pay. For
example, a person who wants to find out about public relations might consider volunteering at a PR firm.
Although responsibilities might be menial in nature, the experience provides the volunteer with insight as to how
a PR firm operates and what is expected of its personnel. Taking a class, selecting a mentor, and conducting
online research provide important education and information, but they do not necessarily provide workplace
experience.

Work experience. There are several ways to obtain work experience without having a paying job. One way is to
participate in school-operated programs, such as the school store or library. Students who help in the school
store learn how to operate cash registers, complete sales transactions, and serve customers. Students who
work in the library also learn about customer service. This experience is similar to work experience and can be
listed on an individual's resume. Helping out in the school store or library is a way of obtaining a type of training
rather than additional education or college information. Students might receive approval for the work they do,
but that is not the purpose of participating.

Credit. Credit is the arrangement in which businesses and individuals can purchase now and pay later. One
option businesses have to obtain credit is to secure credit cards from lending institutions. Businesses can obtain
the goods and services they need right away, such as airline tickets and supplies, and then pay for the items
when they receive their statement from their lending institutions. Businesses often purchase the things they
need to operate effectively online. In fact, many web-based businesses will only accept credit cards as a form of
payment. Debit cards, ATM cards, and store-value (gift) cards do not delay payment.

Continue their education. Employees need to continue learning and improving their skills to keep up with
changes in technology. For example, many businesses are replacing existing equipment with advanced models
that are more complex or perform more operations. Employees need to be willing to learn the skills necessary
to operate advanced equipment because their former skills are obsolete. Employees should not change jobs
frequently. Modifying personal behavior will not necessarily prevent employees' skills from becoming obsolete
unless they also continue their education. Many employees are responsible for performing specific tasks and
are not able to delegate that responsibility to others.

Work in a specific industry. Trade associations often provide continuing educational options for workers who
want or need to expand their skills and knowledge in a specific industry, such as plumbing or building. As
technology evolves, workers often need to attend classes, seminars, and workshops to keep up with the
changes in their industry. Some trade associations offer management training classes, but not all workers need
or want these types of skills. Workers who want to obtain a graduate degree need to attend a college or
university that offers graduate-level programs. People who are near retirement are unlikely to attend continuing
education classes or professional development seminars and workshops.

Being a career salesperson. An occupation is defined as the principal business of one's life. Occupations are
usually paid work that consists of similar activities that are performed by the people during their careers. For
example, people working as salespeople often use the same skills and perform similar tasks in each job they
hold throughout their sales careers. People who obtain part-time jobs generally work fewer hours than full-time
employees. Often, these types of positions are short term and are not always related to one's career goals. For
example, a college student who is studying to become a teacher might work part-time in a quick-service
restaurant to help cover school expenses. People who change jobs within a company do not always move to
similar or occupation-oriented positions. When people explore new employment options, they are generally
looking for new jobs, but the jobs are not always occupational in nature.

Require little or no experience. Entry-level jobs are the beginning point in most occupations because they
require little or no experience. Many people entering the workplace for the first time do not have a lot of work
experience, if any. Therefore, they often begin their careers in entry-level jobs to gain the experience they need
to be able to advance and move up the career ladder. Not all entry-level jobs offer very low compensation.
Many entry-level jobs are the stepping stones to advancement once workers have more experience. Entry-level
jobs are available in all types of businesses, regardless of size.

Job. A job is a temporary step that is part of building a career. A career is a long-term journey that typically
requires planning and growing. Edward is majoring in business, so his career will likely be in the business field.

Monitor trends in their occupations. A trend is defined as the general direction in which people or events are
moving. Many people who monitor the trends in their occupation or profession can determine what skills they
need to enhance or develop and take steps to educate themselves and become more marketable in their fields.
For example, a graphic artist takes desktop publishing classes when software upgrades are released. By
keeping up with the changes in the profession, the graphic artist learns skills that make their job easier as well
as possesses skills that many employers or clients desire. Self-esteem, attitudes, and job acquisition might
affect workers' ability to acquire skills but do not necessarily further their careers.

Make money. Many people start businesses to supplement their existing income or gain financial
independence. However, a business is much more likely to fail if its owner starts it simply to make money.
Money should never be your top priority in starting a new business. If it is, you are much more likely to make
hasty, unwise decisions that may help make money in the short run but will ultimately destroy your chance for
success. Obtaining personal satisfaction, making a difference in the lives of others, and becoming more
independent are all reasons that entrepreneurs start businesses.

Mutual funds. Mutual funds are pools of money from individual investors that are directed by a fund manager.
One of the benefits of investing in a mutual fund is that they are managed by a professional who has the time
and expertise to focus on selecting the right investments. Mutual funds are appropriate for Leena because she
does not have the time or knowledge to choose her own investments. Saving is different than investing.
Insurance would not help Leena in this situation. Growth stocks are risky and require more attention than Leena
can give to be successful.

You accidentally ran a red light and hit another vehicle. Car insurance pays for accidents that you've caused
and accidental damage such as vandalism or weather-related issues. If you run a red light and get into an
accident, you should file a claim with your automobile insurance company. Unless your flat tire was caused by
vandalism, auto insurance will not cover it. Auto insurance also does not cover property stolen from within a
vehicle; it only covers damage to the vehicle itself. Finally, auto insurance does not cover car maintenance
issues such as dead batteries.
