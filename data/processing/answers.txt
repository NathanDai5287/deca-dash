Something of value must be exchanged. A legally binding contract must meet two requirements:
something of value must be exchanged, and both parties must be in agreement with the terms of the
contract. The contract does not necessarily have to be in writing or signed, but it is much easier to
enforce if it is. Finally, a contract does not necessarily have to include a stated expiration date.

Ensure that it is following government regulations. Government regulations affect the way that
businesses record and report financial data. To ensure that the business is following all of the
regulations, it should conduct a compliance audit. Because a comprehensive compliance audit can detect
discrepancies, it can help a business determine what it needs to do to correct a problem, so it can comply
with regulations. It is unethical and often illegal to manipulate financial data in ways that aim to mislead
the audience. Developing efficient production processes and evaluating vendors' performance are not
reasons for conducting a compliance audit.

Fiduciary. A financial agent is someone who acts on the behalf of another party. The agent often
negotiates contracts and handles legal issues for another person with that person's consent. The agent
who shows that s/he is loyal, trustworthy, and acting in the best interest of his/her client (principal) is
fostering a fiduciary relationship. Authoritative relationships are based on a particular level of control.
Principal is a legal term that describes the client. Legislative processes involve the procedures in which
people or governments establish laws.

Phishing. Phishing is an online identity theft scam that fools its victims into believing they are submitting
sensitive, personal information such as bank or credit card numbers to a legitimate website. A Ponzi
scheme is an investment scam that lures new investors by promising high rates of return with little to no
risk. Accounting fraud occurs when a company or organization knowingly publishes incorrect information
on its financial statements. Affinity fraud is an investment scam in which the scammer claims to be a
member of the group s/he is targeting. By claiming to be a member of the group, the target audience is
more likely to trust the scammer and turn over its money to him/her.

Retirement funds and health-savings accounts. Tax shelters such as retirement funds and health-savings
accounts are methods of minimizing taxable income. The government does not tax the income that an
employee places in an employer-sponsored retirement program until the employee withdraws the money
from his/her account. In other words, this portion of the employee's income is tax-deferred. Contributions
to health-savings accounts are tax deductible. Individuals place money in health-savings accounts to help
cover health insurance deductibles. Other tax shelters include real estate, pension plans, and municipal
bonds. Stock, capital gains, and earned income are taxable.

Present facts that support your point of view. Because others may have questions or concerns about

Regulating workplace conditions. Governments pass and enforce laws to protect consumers, businesses,

businesses to pay their employees a minimum hourly wage, it is regulating workplace conditions.
Minimum wage laws protect workers because they are legally guaranteed a living wage, which is a
minimal amount of money needed to meet basic survival needs. To protect the business's property,
including its products and ideas, the government issues trademarks, patents, and copyrights. The
government passes and enforces environmental laws to protect and conserve our natural resources such
as water, air, botanical life, and wildlife from the potentially unhealthy and unsafe outcomes of production
processes. Government provides public welfare programs to assist people who are unable to provide for

Estimate the time that it takes them to perform their tasks. When businesspeople estimate the time that it
takes to perform their tasks, it helps them plan, prioritize, and manage their workloads effectively.
Planning their work helps businesspeople avoid scheduling activities too close together, which can affect
the quality of their work. For example, if it takes a businessperson one hour to prepare a status report
that is due at 4:00 p.m., s/he should not start the report at 3:30 p.m. Because coworkers have their own
work commitments, they only should help in emergencies with management's approval. Pleasant tasks

Objective. Accountants prepare the accounting information that businesses use to make financial
decisions. Therefore, it is important for accountants to uphold the ethical standards of their profession by
providing accurate, objective (unbiased) financial information. A person who uses unique processes or
creativity to achieve a goal is being resourceful. Accountants need to follow the GAAP to perform their
jobs rather than use unique processes. An intolerant person is prejudiced. An unconventional person is
often viewed as unusual or eccentric.

A marginal revenue equal to or greater than marginal cost. Marginal analysis, which involves determining
whether the marginal revenue of a business activity will be equal to or greater than marginal cost or
expense, is used to identify profitable options for an organization. If marginal cost is greater than
marginal revenue, the activity is not likely to be profitable and should not be pursued. Net revenue cannot
be determined until all transactions are measured and accounted for, so it cannot be used to analyze
future business activities.

Carter determined that storage costs exceeded the budgeted amount. Variance analysis helps
managerial accountants see the difference between actual costs and standard costs. They can then
isolate the areas where costs are causing problems and adjust accordingly. Carter can use variance
analysis to determine that a certain cost, such as storage, is causing the organization to go over its
budget. Figuring out which product line would be most profitable, making pricing suggestions, and
informing a manager about the amount of money left for travel are all tasks of managerial accountants,

Share information. Financial information must be available to the people who need it, when they need it.
Often, several employees need to be able to access the financial data at the same time. Businesses that
organize and store their financial data in central databases and provide the ability for multiple, qualified
users to access the data are supporting an environment of information sharing and collaboration. The
primary purpose for storing and retrieving internal financial data is to monitor and evaluate internal
business activities rather than monitor competitors' activities. Measures to secure the database reduce
the risk of unauthorized access to the business's financial data. Businesses can often develop contracts
without financial data that are retrieved from a database.

Waste, quality. Businesses are constantly looking for ways to use their resources more efficiently. Two
popular methods of achieving this goal are lean operations (manufacturing) and Six Sigma. The lean
operations method involves eliminating waste (the ineffective use of resources) to improve efficiency.
According to the lean-operations philosophy, when efficiency increases, the business will have fewer
errors, which leads to higher profits. Six Sigma is a quality-management framework that involves
continuously setting higher goals of perfection. The Six Sigma framework builds upon previous goals to
set higher goals, which continuously improves the quality of the business's goods, services, or
processes. The ultimate goal is to maximize outputs, have no process or product defects, and minimize
production costs. Therefore, an important aspect of the Six Sigma philosophy is to continuously lower
costs while improving quality. Lean operations do not focus on reducing wages, automation, or
standards. Six Sigma does not focus on improving waste.

Mentor. A mentor is an experienced worker who can act as a guide or helper to less experienced
workers. Mentors can be supervisors or coworkers; or, they can be experienced professionals who work
in the same industry, but for other companies. A companion is someone who accompanies another
person to an event or activity. There is not enough information provided to determine if Jan is Sarah's
supervisor, if Jan works as an editor, or if Jan has accompanied Sarah to an activity or event.

Experience less misconduct. When organizations have a strong code of conduct in place, they
experience less misconduct, which has a positive impact on the organization's performance as a whole. If
the code of conduct is linked to its overall objectives, then following the rules will help the organization
obtain success. Strong codes of conduct do not make organizations less ethical, decrease efficiency, or
create difficulties in attracting employees.

94. C
Other employees may not trust you. If you do not follow the organizational structure that has been set up,
other employees may not trust your intentions and reliability. Going against the chain of command will not
necessarily lead to a promotion; in fact, it might keep you from being promoted. Your manager will not
appear to be a strong communicator; rather, his or her communication skills may be questioned. Finally,
you will not necessarily be considered a strong leader; it is more likely, depending on the situation, that
your reputation will be damaged.

95. D
Telling the whole truth to insurance agents. Risk managers have to provide insurance companies with
information about their companies and are required to tell the truth. Misleading insurance companies is
unethical. Keeping insurance information concealed from staff is not necessarily ethical; employees have
a right to know about their insurance information. Maintaining the same policies for as long as possible is
not necessarily ethical; especially if laws have changed. Finally, obtaining the insurance required by law
is not necessarily ethical in and of itself; ethical companies obtain the insurance they need to protect their
employees whether it is required or not.

Intrusion detection systems. An intrusion detection system monitors and detects computer hacking
activities that compromise the security of a business's computer data. Typically used in television studios,
a teleprompter is an off-camera device that projects a script for speakers or performers. The purpose of
concurrency control applications is to address issues that occur when multiple computer users access
the same data at the same time. Pirated software is computer programs that are illegally copied and used
by individuals other than the software owners.

97. D
The insurance policy holders are also the company's stockholders. A risk retention group is a type of
insurance company that is owned by its members—its stockholders. As the owner of the insurance
company, a risk retention group retains and controls its liability rather than transferring its risks to another
entity. Risk retention groups are typically formed by similar businesses and industries and pay lower
licensing fees than traditional insurance companies.

98. B
External; economic. A market crash would be an external risk because it occurs outside of the company's
organization. This is an economic risk factor because it is a change in market conditions. A political risk
factor is a change in the political environment. A technological risk factor is an internal risk that includes
changes in the delivery and/or distribution of the company's product or service.

Enterprise risk management. Enterprise risk management involves a corporation identifying all the risks
that threaten the company, deciding which risks to focus on, and sharing that information with
stakeholders. This is not known as corporate risk organization, competitive risk assessment, or
environmental risk planning.

Change in currency exchange rates. A change in currency exchange rates is outside of a company's
control and is, therefore, an external risk. Significant accounting errors, poor budgeting, and poorly
produced products are all internal risks that occur within an organization.
