$14,436. To determine the remaining amount of Jack's loan, first calculate how much Jack has left to pay after making
the down payment ($23,670 X 80% [or .8] = $18,936). From that amount, subtract the value of the trade-in, which is
$4,500, to obtain the amount Jack would still owe on the car before interest is added ($18,936 - $4,500 = $14,436).

A senior manager tells a stakeholder that the government did not approve a new product because it did not meet
safety standards. When a group of people has access to nonpublic information (material information) and makes
trades based on this knowledge, those individuals have an unfair advantage over others. If the insider (senior
manager) gives this information to others (stakeholders) so they can make trades based on the knowledge, both
parties could be prosecuted for insider trading. In the example, the company's stock values are likely to be affected by
the problems with a new product. When an employee shares material information with a person outside the company
and who can act on the knowledge before it is revealed to the general public, it is an example of illegal insider trading.
On the other hand, officers and board members of a company who buy or sell their own company's securities and
report the trades to the SEC are not conducting illegal insider trading activities. Advising customers about mortgage
rates, giving financial advice to a client, and providing an auditor with the company's material or financial information
are not examples of insider trading.

Evaluate the author's level of credibility. When conducting research for a business, it is important to consider the
source's level of credibility. A person who has extensive knowledge of or expertise in a specific topic is more credible
and more likely to present valid or reliable information. For example, an article about the side effects of a medication
tends to be more credible if it was written by a doctor or pharmacist rather than if the article was written by a financial
planner or mechanic. Although the timeliness of written material is a consideration, it is not related to the author's level
of expertise. A researcher cannot always determine the author's level of emotional intelligence by reading a written
document. And, it is possible to possess a high level of knowledge about a subject and have low emotional
intelligence. The way in which the article is written, rather the author's expertise, will impact the understandability of
the information.

$778. To calculate Kale's loss in purchasing power, first subtract the amount of his raise from the rate of inflation (5% - 3% = 2%). Then, multiply this difference by Kale's income last year (2% X $38,900 = $778). Therefore, Kale loses
$778 in purchasing power. Even though he is receiving a raise, inflation is rising faster than his income, so the amount
of money that he has available to spend decreases.

Secured. In a secured, or collateral, loan, the borrower pledges to the lender some valuable possession as collateral,
or security, to guarantee that the loan will be repaid. If the borrower does not repay the loan, the item that was used
as collateral will then belong to the lender. Among the items that are often used as collateral are real estate, stocks
and bonds, personal property such as machinery or cars, and the cash value of life insurance. An unsecured loan,
also known as a signature loan, is an amount of money borrowed by an individual or a business simply by signing a
promissory note, a written promise to repay the loan. In this type of loan, the borrower is not required to put up
collateral. Installment credit accounts are designed to handle one total amount of credit, which is paid in installments
within a certain time period. The credit user makes a down payment and signs an agreement to pay monthly
installments until the total is paid.

$471.30. The present value of money is equal to the future value of the money divided by the interest factor, which is
equal to the sum of the interest rate and one, raised to the nth power (n is equal to the number of years). To find the
present value of $500 two years in the future, first convert the interest rate to a decimal and add one to it (0.03 + 1 =

1.0609). Finally, divide the amount of money in the future by the interest factor that you just calculated ($500 / 1.0609

criteria, the application is accepted and the loan process begins. The lender develops a formal document (contract)
that the borrower must sign. The document contains information regarding the loan repayment terms and schedules.
The contract does not include a tax code list, a proposal (request) for disbursement, or a guarantee of eminent

12.8%. The lender is required to inform a borrower of the finance charge that is to be paid on their installment loans,
as well as the annual percentage rate (APR) for the loan. To calculate the approximate APR for Annie's loan, first find
the total installment cost for the loan by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of payments and then adding
this answer to the down payment for the loan ($283.27 X 24 = $6,798.48 + $0 = $6,798.48). Then, find the finance
charge—the total interest that Annie will be required to pay on the loan—by subtracting the amount of the loan from
the total installment cost ($6,798.48 - $6,000 = $798.48). To find the approximate APR, multiply the finance charge by
24, which is a constant in the formula for approximate APR ($798.48 X 24 = $19,163.52). Next, add one (also a
constant in the formula) to the number of payments (1 + 24 = 25). Multiply this sum by the amount financed (25 X
$6,000 = $150,000). Finally, divide this answer into $19,163.52 ($19,163.52 / $150,000 = 0.128 = 12.8%).

Purchase. When individuals make investments, they receive purchase documents that include information about the
cost of the investment and any commissions or fees that were paid. Individuals should keep these documents in their
records to verify ownership and to be able to determine if it was a good investment over a period of time. For
example, the purchase record would indicate the cost (perhaps it was $25 a share), the total amount purchased (100
shares for a total of $2,500), and a fee of $30. By comparing the purchase records to actual value in five years, an
individual will be able to decide if the investment was worthwhile. Perhaps the cost per share is $40 a share in five
years. An individual might consider this to be a good return on the investment. Deposit and credit records usually do
not contain information about investments. Logistics refer to managing the flow of goods and services from production
to consumption.

Charitable gifts. A deduction is a tax write-off that reduces the gross amount of an individual's income, which in turn
reduces the taxes owed. Deductible expenses include donations to qualified charities. By claiming the charitable gift
deduction, you can decrease your taxable income and lower your tax bill. To successfully claim the charitable
contribution deduction, you need to donate cash or property, contribute to a qualified tax-exempt organization, and
meet recordkeeping requirements. Political contributions, rent payments, and lunches with coworkers are not
expenses that are tax deductible.

Loan. A loan is a sum of money lent to a person or business for a specific time period that is repayable with interest.
Credit is the arrangement by which a person purchases now and pays later. A lending institution issues credit cards,
which allow people to purchase now and pay later. The lender provides credit card users with a limit within which they
can charge purchases. The lender pays for the purchases and then sends the credit card user a bill/statement each
month that indicates the monthly minimum payment and interest charges due to the lender. It is important for people
to pay credit card balances responsibly so they do not accumulate so much debt that they cannot afford to pay the
lender. Using credit for purchases helps a person build a personal credit history, which lenders consider when a
person applies for a large loan to purchase a car or a house. An asset is something of value that a person owns.
Credit is not an asset or a tax. Because credit is so widely used, it is not necessarily a privilege.

Manage your spending. When you have one or two credit cards, it is easier to manage your spending because you
have a limited amount of purchases that you can place on each card. With fewer cards, it is easier to track your
purchases and this may enable you to pay more than the minimum amount due on each card, which helps you reduce
your debt more quickly. Having one or two credit cards may not enable you to buy everything that you want, but it can
help you prioritize your needs and wants so you don't overspend. The credit card service provider establishes the
policies for transaction fees and credit limits, regardless of the number of credit cards that you hold.

401(k) plans. Many employers offer 401(k) plans, which are defined-contribution pension plans, to their employees.
Employees contribute to their 401(k) plans on a pretax basis, and many employers match employees' contributions up
to a certain percentage. Both the employee's and employer's contributions become part of the employee's nest-egg
for retirement. A traditional IRA (individual retirement account) is a personal savings plan that an employee can set up
independent of their employer. Contributions to a traditional IRA are usually tax deductible, but the money in the
account is taxed when it is withdrawn during retirement. Money contributed to a Roth IRA is not tax deductible, but the
money withdrawn from a Roth IRA during retirement is not taxed. A Keogh plan is a defined contribution pension plan
specifically for self-employed individuals. Contributions to a Keogh plan are typically tax deductible, but withdrawals
from the account during retirement are taxed.

Use secure web browsers when purchasing online. Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another
person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people
should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because internet sales transactions often require a person to
provide credit card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure websites
reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to
reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes
up because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others. When
more people know an individual's banking information, the risk of identity theft increases. Everyday cash transactions
do not require a purchaser to provide personal information and, therefore, do not pose a high risk for identity theft.

Monitor your credit and bank accounts continuously. By reviewing your credit card statements and your bank
accounts on a regular basis, you are more likely to detect credit purchases or bank withdrawals that you did not make.
If unauthorized transactions have occurred, you can quickly close accounts to stop identity thieves from accessing
your accounts. Other things you can do to protect yourself from identity theft are use different passwords for each of
your online accounts and use secure websites when paying bills and shopping online. Not all online sites are secure.
You should use the same caution with your debit card as you do with your credit accounts and other bank accounts.

Sherise's potential financial advisor charges an asset management fee of 1.5% per year. To determine how much

Mutual funds. A mutual fund is a collection of shareholders' money that is invested by professional fund managers in
an assortment of different securities, such as stocks and bonds. Because the money is spread out over different types
of investments, it provides the investor with a diversified portfolio. If one stock performs poorly, the investor still has
many other types of investments in the fund that may be performing well, which reduces the risk of severe financial
losses. Corporations sell corporate bonds to investors as a way to raise cash for their businesses. The corporation
(borrower) pays back the full amount plus interest to the investor within a certain time. A certificate of deposit is a type
of lending investment in which the investor lends the money to the bank at a set interest rate for a particular period of
time. The government issues Treasury bonds. The government pays back the full amount of the bond plus interest to
the investor over a certain time frame, which varies by the type of Treasury bond purchased.

You can often write checks from a money market account. Money market accounts and savings accounts are very

closing price) from the last price for the day ($35.01 - $0.62 = $34.39). The price/earnings ratio (P/E) indicates how
much higher the stock share price is than its earnings per share. So, Home Depot's stock share price is 18.92 times
higher than its earnings per share. The lowest price paid for Home Depot stock during the last year was $26.62. An

Money market fund. A money market fund's purpose is to provide investors with a safe place to invest easily

stock option is a method of putting down money on the chance that the value of a stock will increase. An individual
purchasing a stock option is not buying the stock; they are buying the opportunity to buy the stock if the prices reach a

become public. Investing in a startup company, often referred to as venture capitalism, refers to providing funds to
companies that need money to get their business started. Stock options, IPO's, and venture capitalism are all high

payments for a specific period of time. Forbearance lets you deal with your short-term financial problems by giving
you time to get back on your feet before resuming payments. Bankruptcy is a process that allows consumers and
businesses to repay some or all of their debts under the protection of the federal bankruptcy court. Filing for
bankruptcy is a last-resort option and is not a process that should be pursued to relieve temporary hardship.
Reimbursement and loan subsidy are not options for postponing loan payments.

You only make minimum payments on bills. Only paying the minimum amount due each month means that, in the
future, you are expected to pay both the balance due and an additional fee for interest. For someone paying the
minimum each month, paying off this additional money is difficult, so it becomes an endless cycle of debt. Having an
emergency fund, even small, is not necessarily an indicator of excessive debt. Many people in excessive debt don't
know actually how much they owe; chances are, if they “hide” from their debt, they have a large amount they are
afraid they cannot pay. Another sign of excessive debt is if your credit cards are generally declined, not accepted.

Verify its accuracy. A credit report is a record of your credit history. Businesses and individuals can obtain their credit
reports from authorized credit bureaus. The advantage to reviewing your credit report on a regular basis is that you
can verify that the information is correct. Incorrect information can affect your ability to obtain credit or a loan, so it is
important to check for and correct any inaccurate information that you find in your credit report. Businesses and
individuals can improve their credit scores by using credit wisely and by taking action to correct inaccurate
information; however, they cannot change credit scores—only authorized credit bureaus can do so. Credit card
issuers set credit limits and often review your credit report to determine the amount of credit they are willing to extend
to you. Credit reports do not identify discriminatory practices.

Someone who is not personally disciplined to save for retirement. If a person lacks the discipline to save for
retirement, working for a company that makes retirement contributions on their behalf is ideal. An employee working
for Company B would receive a salary of $45,000 plus 10% of their salary, which equals $4,500 per year. The total
financial gains received from Company B starting in year two would equal $49,500, which is only $500 less in overall
compensation than Company A offers. People who are skilled at investing or disciplined to save for retirement may
benefit more from the slightly larger salary offered by Company A. A person who will work less than one year will not
gain the $4,500 retirement contribution, so they would gain much more income from Company A.

Contributions are deducted before earnings are taxed. Deducting contributions from earnings reduces taxable income,
which also lowers the amount of tax withheld from a person's paychecks. Contributions to a 401(k) are not taxed when
they are contributed, but are taxed upon withdrawal instead. Net earnings are not taxed. While many employers
match 401(k) contributions, doing so doesn't reduce the taxes withheld from a person's paycheck.

Lower. APR stands for annual percentage rate, which represents the amount of interest on your total loan that you'll
pay annually. It takes into account the interest rates, the length of the loan agreement, and other fees or charges. If
you have a lower APR, your monthly payments will be lower. A higher APR means higher monthly payments. Whether
or not monthly payments are stable or fluctuating depends on whether or not the interest rate is fixed or adjustable.

Personal loans generally have higher interest rates than secured loans. Personal loans are a type of unsecured
loan—an amount of money borrowed by an individual simply by signing a written promise to repay the loan. Because
they are considered high-risk loans, personal loans tend to have high interest rates and are generally reserved for
people with excellent credit ratings. Personal loans are very flexible, meaning they can be used for a variety of
purposes. For applicants with good credit scores, personal loans are generally easy to apply for and to receive.

Both employees and employers must pay Medicare tax. Both employees and employers are responsible for paying
Medicare and Social Security tax. While Social Security tax is only levied on the first $147,000 of an employee's gross

either Social Security or Medicare—they must pay both. A withholding allowance, also called an exemption, is a

Suggest the friend group go to a cost-conscious restaurant. By going out to eat with his friends but selecting a less
expensive restaurant, Jared is able to satisfy both of his goals: spend less money and spend time with his friends.
Eating dinner at home would be the cheapest option, but then Jared would not see his friends. Going out to dinner but
not leaving a tip is considered rude and might not save Jared that much money. Ordering something from the
restaurant but taking it to-go means Jared would both spend more money than he needs to by eating out and not be
able to eat with his friends.

Quality of information. For information to be useful, it must be accurate and current. Therefore, businesses and
individuals evaluate the quality of information they obtain to determine if it is relevant to the issue, accurate, and
current. Information that is out-of-date or that includes errors will not be helpful. The business or individual might make
poor decisions based on information that is of low quality. Businesses and individuals do not evaluate the research

Determine whether the information is unbiased, accurate, and current. Before doing anything with financial

Overestimate the amount of loss. Fraud is a deception purposely carried out to secure unfair or unlawful gain. If a

involved in insurance fraud if they attempt to reduce the coverage, calculate the value of property, or limit their scope
of liability.

The project manager can tell him what a real day on the job is like. Perry can gain many benefits from doing an
informational interview with a current project manager. The project manager can tell him what their typical work day is
like, what sort of education or training they had, what they like or dislike about the job, and what sorts of skills it takes
to excel in their position. Personal information like this may help Perry decide whether or not project management is
the profession for him. Perry shouldn't assume the project manager will give him a job, although having a connection
may come in handy when he's job hunting many years down the road. The project manager will not be able to make
Perry's decisions for him; all they can do is tell Perry about their experience. It's probably not a good idea for Perry to
expect the project manager to help him with his application; after all, it's a pretty big favor to ask someone to speak
with him. He should make sure not to ask too much of the interviewee. He also should make sure to write a thank-you
note.

What buyers are willing to pay for the stock. How much a stock sells for depends directly on what buyers are willing to
pay for it. The company's earnings and new products may influence what buyers are willing to pay, but they do not
directly affect how much a stock sells for. A stock's volatility (its movement in relation to the market as a whole) does
not determine how much a stock sells for—but rather, reflects the stock's price changes over time.
